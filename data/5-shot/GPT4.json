    "0": "Hello, I can understand your concern about your brother's health. It's quite often difficult to identify specific items in stool without a little more investigation or testing. The \"kidney bean\" like objects can likely be undigested food particles, medications, or possibly the result of his ostomy. Sometimes certain medications or foods are not fully digested and may mimic this appearance. However, as your brother has a history of colorectal cancer and ongoing chemotherapy, it is crucial that any new noticeable changes in his stool be reported to his treating oncologist or gastroenterologist promptly. They may want to examine the stool to further understand and rule out any complications. However, this advice is based on the limited information given and may not replace a consultation with a healthcare provider. Please make sure to inform his doctor about this. Best wishes for his treatment.",
    "1": "Hello, from your symptoms, it seems that you might be dealing with severe gastroenteritis which is causing vomiting for a week. The high blood pressure might be due to the stress on your body from being unwell and dehydrated. The stinging feeling in your heart and shortness of breath can be related to stress, dehydration, or it might be a sign of a heart condition that needs to be ruled out. \n\nI recommend that you seek immediate medical care. In the meantime, try to stay as hydrated as possible and get some rest. You might need intravenous fluids, antinausea medications, and other treatments. \n\nI suggest you to report this constellation of symptoms to a nearby healthcare provider as soon as possible. If your symptoms persist or get worse, it's important to seek immediate medical attention.",
    "2": "I'm really sorry to hear about your brother's situation. Treating throat cancer depends significantly on the stage and type of the cancer, the patient's general health, and the patient's personal preferences. \n\nPeople with throat cancer often receive some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. It sounds like your brother is in a late stage of the disease since he cannot eat and has a tube for oxygen, so surgery might not be an option. In this case, radiation and/or chemotherapy are typically used to try to slow the progression of the disease and relieve symptoms.\n\nHowever, it's concerning that you say your brother is in pain and isn't receiving enough care. Pain management is a fundamental part of cancer treatment. I would recommend that you or another family member advocate for better care -- speak to his doctors, nurses, or hospital administrators and insist on proper pain relief. You may also want to consider getting a second opinion or transferring him to a different hospital. \n\nPlease keep in mind that this suggestion is based on the limited information given and should not be substituted for a physical examination by a healthcare professional. Wishing all the best for your brother's health.",
    "3": "Hello Richard,\n\nIt sounds like you're experiencing nocturnal leg cramps. This can be a common occurrence, especially among people with diabetes. Often, this can be related to issues with the nerves in your legs or potentially to poor circulation. Underlying causes may also include electrolyte imbalances or even the use of certain medications. \n\nHere's what I'd suggest:\n\n1. Stay Hydrated: Dehydration can often cause muscle cramps, so ensure you're drinking enough water each day.\n2. Stretch before bed: Stretching your leg muscles before you sleep can help reduce the frequency of night time leg cramps. \n3. Review your medications: Sometimes, certain medications can cause muscle cramps. Discuss this with your physician who can make necessary medication changes or adjustments if required.\n4. Consider a magnesium supplement: Low levels of magnesium can lead to muscle cramps. Since you're a diabetic, you must, however, consult with your doctor before starting any supplements.\n\nRemember to mention your symptoms and the duration of these symptoms when you next consult your physician. They may opt to check your electrolyte levels or review your medications to help alleviate these symptoms. Meanwhile, for the relief from pain, as long as you don't have any kidney problems, you could take an over-the-counter pain medication like Tylenol or ibuprofen, but only after discussing it with your healthcare provider.",
    "4": "Hello. I understand your concern. Chest pain with palpitations can sometimes be alarming. Regarding the chest pain, it can be due to various reasons. Since you have undergone ECG, which is normal, it reduces the chances of the chest pain being cardiac in origin. However, it can also be due to gastritis, gastric reflux, stress or anxiety. I would suggest you to consult with your doctor again and maybe undergo some further investigations, such as a 24-hour Holter monitor, echo or a stress test to rule out any cardiac cause which could have been missed in an ECG. Your medications might also need to be reviewed and perhaps adjusted. Please seek immediate medical help if your symptoms worsen. Take care.",
    "5": "Given the symptoms described, it sounds like the child may have a common infection such as strep throat or even just a viral infection, both of which can cause a sore throat, painful tongue, and swollen lymph nodes. These are quite typical symptoms in children and not necessarily associated directly with the family history of Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nHowever, if he has high fever, difficulty breathing or swallowing, or if his symptoms are getting worse quickly, a trip to the ER would be warranted.\n\nIf not, I recommend making an appointment with his pediatrician as soon as possible. If pain is severe or concerning, it wouldn't be wrong to visit the ER to have him checked out immediately. His comfort and wellbeing is priority. The presence of these symptoms doesn't imply that he has developed a Hodgkin's lymphoma like your family history; common diseases happen commonly.",
    "6": "Hello, the symptoms you're experiencing, such as severe abdominal pain, back pain, migraines, feelings of pressure in the lower abdomen, and passing a blood clot outside of your menstrual cycle, can be due to several possible conditions, including a hormonal imbalance, an ovarian cyst, endometriosis, or possibly a urinary tract infection. There is also a chance that the blood clot could be related to gastrointestinal issues, such as a gastrointestinal bleed. It's important that you seek immediate medical attention to get to the root of these symptoms. You may need tests such as a pelvic examination, ultrasound, or endoscopy. Do not delay seeking help, as you've mentioned passing a blood clot which is not a normal occurrence and needs immediate investigation.",
    "7": "I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this issue. Gum infections can be quite painful and if left untreated, can lead to more serious conditions. Unfortunately, without a proper dental examination, it's difficult to determine the severity of your infection. Typically, for mild gum infections, improving your dental hygiene habits along with using antibacterial mouthwash and toothpaste might help. Regular brushing and flossing is crucial. Over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage the pain.\n\nHowever, given your description of the severity of pain and bleeding, it's important that you schedule an appointment with a dentist as soon as possible. They may need to provide a professional cleaning to remove any plaque and tartar that's contributing to the infection. If the infection is severe, they might prescribe antibiotics. It's crucial to not delay seeing a professional as gum infections can lead to loss of teeth and other systemic infections if left untreated. \n\nIn the meantime, try rinsing your mouth with warm salt water a couple of times a day to relieve some of the pain and inflammation. It's a good step but does not replace the need for a professional dental evaluation.",
    "8": "Hello. Upper abdominal pain at 36 weeks of pregnancy might be due to stretching of the muscles and ligaments supporting your uterus. This can also be due to heartburn, gastrointestinal reflux or your baby kicking or moving around. However, if the pain is severe, there's a chance it could be a sign of a more serious condition like preeclampsia, which is marked by high blood pressure. \n\nIf this pain is severe and persistent, accompanied by other symptoms like headache, changes in vision, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, sudden weight gain or swelling (especially in your hands or face), it is critical to seek immediate medical attention, as these may be signs of preeclampsia. \n\nHowever, if the pain is manageable and not accompanied by the above-mentioned symptoms, it should be safe to wait for your next appointment to discuss this with your obstetrician. Still, if you feel uneasy about it, don’t hesitate to call your doctor immediately.",
    "9": "Welcome. I understand your concerns. Let's start by addressing your two main issues separately.\n\nFirstly, the internal hemorrhoid: If you're experiencing symptoms such as rectal bleeding, itching and discomfort, you should schedule an appointment with your doctor. These symptoms can sometimes indicate other serious disorders, including colorectal cancer. Don't make a self-diagnosis - let a professional have a look.\n\nSecondly, your concern about the changes in your scrotum, penis, and urine flow: these might be related to a few different conditions including overall aging changes, varicoceles, hydroceles, hypogonadism (low testosterone) or a urinary tract issue. It's important that you meet with a urologist so they can do a thorough examination and possibly order tests, which may include blood tests, urinalysis, or ultrasound imaging.\n\nAgain, I strongly suggest you make an appointment with your healthcare provider given the symptoms you're experiencing. These are not normal changes and warrant a medical evaluation. Don't panic, but please be proactive in seeking care.",
    "10": "I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing discomfort. It definitely sounds like your piercing may have become infected. It's important to not squeeze it any further, as this could potentially spread the infection. \n\nHere's what I advise:\n\n1) Remove the belly ring: Although it might be painful, it's important to remove the jewelry to allow the infection to drain. \n\n2) Clean the area: Use warm water and gentle soap to clean the area twice daily. Try not to touch the piercing more than you need to, and always wash your hands first. \n\n3) Apply a warm compress: A warm compress can help to increase circulation to the area and decrease swelling. \n\n4) Over-the-counter treatments: You may want to consider using an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment, but if the infection doesn't improve or if it gets worse, you should definitely see a healthcare provider.\n\n5) Consult with a healthcare provider: Even if the infection improves, you should still make an appointment with your GP or a healthcare provider to ensure that the infection has completely cleared and to confirm if it is safe to get the area repierced.\n\nRemember, it's important to not leave an infected piercing untreated as this could lead to scarring or more serious complications.",
    "11": "Hello, \n\nI understand your concerns. The mold that you found on your dish drying mat and counter is not likely to cause any harm, especially since none of you have shown any symptoms of illness. Most common types of mold in homes aren't harmful for healthy individuals. They could, however, trigger allergies or asthma attacks in people who are allergic or sensitive to it.\n\nJust make sure you clean your dishes thoroughly before using them, and keep your kitchen clean and dry to prevent mold growth. \n\nIf your family continues to remain symptom-free (not showing any signs of respiratory distress, skin irritations, or gastrointestinal issues), then it's safe to say that there's no need to worry. But if any of you do develop symptoms, please seek medical care.\n\nLet me reassure you that finding mold in the house is not uncommon and in most cases it's not harmful. The most important thing is that you've removed the source of the mold. Stay vigilant about keeping areas clean and dry, especially those that are prone to moisture.\n\nRemember, if there are any changes in health or if you have any further concerns to reach out to a healthcare provider.\n\nBest regards.",
    "12": "I'm here to help and not to judge. It sounds like you're experiencing a serious issue. You may have injected the drugs into tissue instead of a vein, leading to localized inflammation or infection, known as an abscess. This can be very serious and needs immediate medical attention. Please visit an emergency room or urgent care clinic as soon as possible for an appropriate evaluation and treatment. In the meantime, stop injecting in this area, apply warm compresses for 15 minutes at a time to promote blood flow, and keep the area clean. Please consider seeking help for your addiction. It's never too late to start a path towards recovery, and there are many resources and people out there who are eager to help you.",
    "13": "I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing this. Your symptoms, alongside the numbness in your thigh, suggest a persistent neural issue potentially related to the ongoing spinal degeneration and stenosis. The \"cell phone on vibrate\" feeling is likely some kind of nerve sensation, possibly due to the nerve irritation or compression. \n\nWhile it's good that you're more active than before, it's also important to bear in mind that certain activities, particularly repetitive heavy lifting or being in and out of the car multiple times a day, could potentially exacerbate degenerative conditions or put additional strain on your spine.\n\nRegarding advice on what to do: \n\n1. Discuss these new symptoms with your doctor. You may need a fresh assessment and perhaps a new MRI to understand what's going on right now. \n\n2. Review your pain management strategy with your doctor, you might benefit from additional or different approaches.\n\n3. Continuing to lose weight will likely help to reduce the load on your spine.\n\n4. Consider consulting with a physical therapist who can provide you with exercises to help build your core strength, flexibility, and stability, which can help support your spine.\n\n5. If your job involves a lot of lifting, check to make sure you're doing it safely (utilizing a back brace, using your legs not your back, not twisting while you lift). It may also be helpful to review your seating posture when driving to make sure you are protecting your spine as much as possible.\n\nI hope",
    "14": "Hello, based on the symptoms you described it sounds like you might be experiencing something called peripheral neuropathy, which can produce symptoms like burning, numbness, pain, and reduced stamina in the leg.  Common causes include diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, or a history of heavy alcohol consumption. It can also be related to a pinched nerve due to heavy physical activity or improper posture during sitting or sleeping.   \n \nHowever, to confirm the diagnosis, you should consult with your primary healthcare provider who might refer you to a neurologist if needed. They might want to perform some tests including blood tests for sugar levels and vitamin B12 levels, and an EMG/NCV to check the conduction of nerves in the lower limbs.\n\nDon't be overly worried about people scaring you about high sugar levels, although it is a possibility. It's best to get a proper consultation and find the actual cause. \n\nAs for treatment options, pain management with medications, physiotherapy, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, keeping the weight under control, proper foot care, treating the underlying cause (like diabetes or vitamin B12 deficiency) can all help.\n\nAlso, remember, don't take any medication without consulting your doctor first. Please book an appointment with a health care practitioner for better evaluation and management.\n\nKind Regards.",
    "15": "Hello Latha, \n\nAt 3 1/2 years old, most children have a high amount of energy and short attention spans, especially in settings like a classroom which can be less stimulating than play activities. It's also normal for children this age to have difficulty waiting their turn and being patient. \n\nYou mentioned that your son is very intelligent. Often, intelligent children require additional stimulation to keep them interested and focused. If the classroom activities aren't challenging enough or don't match his interests, he may lose focus and become restless.\n\nHere are few suggestions that might help with his focus and patience: \n\n1. Make sure he is getting plenty of physical activity outside of the classroom. Regular exercise can help him burn off excess energy and improve his ability to focus. \n\n2. Break tasks down into small manageable parts. If a task seems too large or intimidating, he may lose focus. By breaking it down, he may feel more accomplishment and stay more engaged.\n\n3. Use tools to help him focus. For example, a timer can help him understand how long he needs to work on a task before he can take a break.\n\n4. Develop a consistent routine. Having a routine can help him know what to expect and when to expect it, which can improve his patience.\n\n5. Use positive reinforcement. When he does manage to stay focused or show patience, praise him for it. Positive reinforcement can be a powerful motivator.\n\nIf you notice his inability to focus continues or worsens,",
    "16": "Sorry to hear your little one is going through this. It seems like there might be an issue with either reflux or possibly a gastrointestinal problem. It's equally important to rule out food allergies or intolerance as well.\n\nYou should first try to limit each meal's size and increase the number of meals throughout the day. Eating smaller meals more frequently might help reduce the vomiting. \n\nIn addition, try to keep your baby upright for at least half an hour after each feed; this can help keep food in the stomach and decrease the chances of vomiting. \n\nContinuing breastfeeding or formula is important at this age, so even if he's vomiting, do keep offering him milk. \n\nGiven the weight loss and the frequency of vomiting, I recommend that your baby is seen by a local pediatrician or gastroenterologist to investigate further. They may suggest doing tests to explore if there's an underlying condition causing the vomiting.\n\nIn regards to the phlegm problem, it could be related to an upper respiratory tract infection, or it could be an allergic response. Once again, this should be assessed by a healthcare professional to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. \n\nTry to give him more fluids, fruits, and vegetables which are high in fiber and may also help him to stay hydrated. It's important to avoid dehydration which could make the vomiting worse. \n\nAlways consult with your pediatrician for appropriate advice tailored to your baby's situation.

Going back to Cilacar T, which includes a combination of cilnidipine and telmisartan, seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, keep in mind your doctor's advice is based on close observation of your health parameters. It may take some time for your BP to stabilise with any new medication changes. Repeat BP checks and continual communication with your doctor is key.\n\nLifestyle changes such as salt restriction in your diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol and tobacco, and maintaining a healthy weight also play an important role in controlling high blood pressure. \n\nPlease always consult with your doctor or a healthcare professional regarding medication changes.

    "18": "I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through. You have certainly been through a rough time. To answer your question, myopathies are diseases that primarily cause dysfunction of the muscles. The symptoms are usually weakness, muscle atrophy (decrease in muscle mass), or muscle stiffness. Your previous muscle loss could be attributed to disuse from the arm being in a cast or sling for an extended period of time. Given the multiple surgeries and infections you have had in your arm, it is also possible that scar tissue has formed, which can sometimes feel hard and could be mistaken for muscle issues. \n\nIt is also important to mention that infection can cause inflammation, which can result in hardening, swelling, and pain in the affected area. \n\nIf you are unsure, it would be valuable to have a discussion with your doctor or to seek a second opinion. The symptoms you describe warrant further investigation, but it's not necessarily indicative of myopathies—infections, scar tissue, or disused muscle could create similar manifestations. Your doctor may consider ordering an EMG (Electromyography) to measure muscle response or electrical activity in response to a nerve's stimulation of the muscle to further investigate. \n\nAnd lastly, it's crucial to follow up closely with your doctor to ensure the infection has completely cleared. If you experience fever, increased swelling, redness, or pus drainage from the surgical area, seek immediate medical attention. Wishing you a swift recovery.",
    "19": "Good Morning Vicky. It's completely normal for the penis to become bigger during sexual stimulation and smaller when not stimulated. This is due to the blood flow changes during these scenarios. Understand that the size of the penis when not erect has no impact on fertility or the ability to satisfy your partner sexually. Fertility depends more on the sperm count and motility, not the penis size. The vagina is most sensitive in the first 1-2 inches, hence a penis of any size can stimulate those nerves effectively. If you're concerned about your fertility, a semen analysis can be helpful. Enjoy the intimacy with your partner and don't worry about the size or the look of your penis in its non-erect state. Take care.",
    "20": "I understand your concern. Given the nature of the pain and its increased frequency, it would be wise to have it checked out by a medical professional. While it may not necessarily be your heart -- it could be anything from a muscle strain to indigestion -- the location of the pain should always dictate caution. It's more urgent if you're also experiencing other symptoms like difficulty breathing, pain radiating to your jaw or arm, or you break out in a cold sweat. If these occur, you should seek immediate medical attention. For now, make an appointment with your General Practitioner or a cardiologist who can perform appropriate tests, such as an EKG or a stress test, to ensure your heart is functioning properly. Assume the safer course in this case for peace of mind.",
    "21": "Hello, Thank you for your question. The amount of genital hair varies person to person and there aren't specific amounts you should have by a certain age. You're in the midst of puberty so changes to your body like growing more hair is normal.\n\nRegarding the prostate exam at your age, it is unusual for that to take place. Prostate exams are usually not conducted until later in life because prostate issues are very rare in teenagers. Similarly, it's not standard practice for a doctor to demonstrate how to perform a testicular cancer self-exam on themselves. \n\nIf you have any concerns about how your physical exams are being conducted, it's important to speak to a parent or guardian about it. Always remember that during any medical examination, you have the right to request a chaperone or parent to be in the room with you if that makes you feel more comfortable. \n\nIt's great you're taking an active role in your health, understanding your body's changes during puberty and learning about preventative measures for your health is essential.

    "22": "Hello, \n\nYour description refers to age-related changes in your cervical spine (neck) and thoracic spine (upper to mid-back). \"Spondylotic changes\" refer to degeneration of the discs or joints of the spine that can occur over time due to wear and tear, age, or arthritis. \n\n\"Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis\" means the natural S-shaped curve of the neck is somewhat reduced. This can happen due to muscle strain or tension. \n\n\"Narrowed disc spaces at C4/5 and C5/6\" refers to the spaces between your 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical vertebrae (bones in the neck), which have become narrower. This usually happens because the discs (the cushion-like tissues between the bones) are wearing out or degenerating.\n\n\"Small osteophytes encroach on the foramina\" refers to small bony spurs, called osteophytes, that have formed because of the degeneration. These are encroaching on the spaces (foramina) where nerves exit the spinal cord, which can potentially lead to symptoms if these nerves become impinged or irritated. \n\n\"Very minimal thoracic spondylosis\" refers to similar mild degeneration changes in the upper/mid part of your back.\n\nThese changes are fairly typical in adults, especially as age increases.

From what you have described it seems that you have a persistent, unresponsive cough which could be due to a variety of reasons like uncontrolled asthma, post nasal drip, or even GERD, a type of acid reflux condition. Since you have now been referred to a pulmonologist (lung doctor), further tests like a lung function test, bronchoscopy, or even CT scan of chest may be needed. I understand this has been a very discomforting issue for you but hang in there, you are on the right path and will soon get to the bottom of this.\n\nThe metallic taste can sometimes be a side effect of certain medications, can be caused by post-nasal drip or acid reflux (which can also lead to persistent cough). But, the only way to know for sure is to continue your investigations with the lung specialist and discuss all these symptoms and concerns with them. I hope you find relief soon.",
    "25": "Hello, it sounds like you may have a cyst or possibly an enlarged lymph node, both of which can commonly occur in this area. The fact that it has decreased in size and is not causing pain unless bumped against is typically a good sign and often indicates it may be a benign issue.\n\nHowever, without examining you in person and potentially ordering imaging or a biopsy, it's not possible to provide a definite diagnosis. It's always a good idea to have new growths checked out by a healthcare provider. If the lump continues to persist, change in size, or starts to cause discomfort, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with your healthcare provider to have it evaluated further.\n\nRemember this advice is intended to be general in nature, you should contact your health provider for advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

    "26": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing these symptoms. Asthma is a chronic condition, meaning there's no definitive cure, but it can be managed effectively.\n\nIt seems you already know some of the triggers for your symptoms, such as eating oily foods, dairy products, and ice cream. It's great that you're aware because avoidance of triggers is one crucial step in managing asthma. \n\nNext, you should have a fast-acting rescue inhaler (bronchodilator) like albuterol for immediate relief when you feel an asthma attack coming on. Also, depending on the severity of your asthma, you may need daily long-acting inhalers or medications to help control inflammation and reduce the number of asthma attacks you have. \n\nI would recommend you to work closely with your doctor or a specialist like a pulmonologist. They can guide you on what combination of medications would be beneficial for you and perhaps develop an Asthma Action Plan. This is a plan that outlines what medications to take when you're feeling good, when you're ill, and when experiencing an asthma attack and also when to seek immediate medical help. \n\nLastly practicing a healthy lifestyle can help manage your asthma. This would involve regular exercise (as tolerated), maintaining a healthy weight, and not smoking.\n\nHowever, remember this advice is general in nature, and personal health advice should be sought from your healthcare provider.",

The total sperm count should be at least 20 million/ml and yours is just over half, at 11 million/ml. Additionally, your sperm motility (active movement) is slightly below normal levels. At least 40% of your sperm should be moving, and of these, at least 32% should be progressively motile (moving forward). Your results indicate that 50% are non-motile, which is a bit high.\n\nThe presence of pus cells suggests there may be an ongoing infection that could need treatment with antibiotics. There are also red cells seen in your semen, which can suggest inflammation or injury.\n\nAll these factors can make natural conception more difficult, but not necessarily impossible. There are several measures you can take to improve these values, including lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate hydration, maintaining a healthy weight, and taking multivitamin supplements, particularly those including folic acid and zinc.\n\nYou can consult a fertility specialist or urologist, who might conduct further tests to identify underlying causes, and suggest any necessary treatments, like hormonal therapy, surgery, or assisted reproductive techniques if required.\n\nAgain, this is just one analysis and it can vary from time to time. Further investigations and discussions with a specialist can provide a clearer picture, so please do consult your doctor for a thorough evaluation.\n\n",
    "29": "Your symptoms of spinning sensations and vomiting upon waking up are characteristic of a condition called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is a disorder that originates in the inner ear, leading to episodes of vertigo when you change the position of your head, such as when you roll over in bed or get up.\n\nWhile the condition is not life-threatening, it can severely affect quality of life by making you feel unsteady or out of balance. Treatment usually involves a series individualized maneuvers and exercises performed by a health care provider to move the disruptive particles in the inner ear, which often resolves the condition.\n\nHowever, other conditions may also elicit similar symptoms, such as Ménière's disease, vestibular neuritis and migraine. Therefore, medical advice should be sought to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude potentially more serious causes of vertigo. You might want to consult your healthcare provider, who will typically refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist who deals with these conditions.\n\nLastly, staying hydrated, adequate rest, and avoiding abrupt head movements might help in alleviating your symptoms. Please reach out to healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific situation.",
    "30": "I understand your worry. It's good that you've had it checked out by your doctor and had an ultrasound done. It is, however, concerning that the lump seems larger despite the ultrasound not showing anything. At your age, breast cancer is extremely rare but it's important to always stay vigilant. This could be something like a fibroadenoma, a non-cancerous lump that's common in young women, or even a cyst. \n\nIf the lump continues to get bigger or you develop other symptoms such as nipple discharge or pulling in of the nipple, skin changes, or swelling of the armpit, definitely go back to your doctor to express your concerns for further investigations. It might also be worth considering a second opinion since you still feel a lump and it's getting bigger. A biopsy might be an additional step to definitively confirm whether the lump is benign or malignant. \n\nRemember, most breast lumps are benign, especially in young women.

    "32": "Dear Patient,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your symptoms. The first thing you must do is remember that self-diagnosis can cause unnecessary anxiety. It's better to rely on a professional's advice. In regard to your symptoms, chronic coughing and mucus production are common symptoms of chronic bronchitis, a form of COPD, or could also represent asthma or an atypical infection.\n\nDespite your lungs sounding clear during an office visit, if you're still worried, your doctor can use a spirometry test to diagnose COPD. Even though you're not a smoker, you were exposed to secondhand smoke, which does increase your risk of developing COPD.\n\nSpirometry involves you blowing into a large hose connected to a machine, called a spirometer. This test measures your overall lung function and, when compared to norms, helps determine the severity, if COPD is present. Additional work-up like a chest X-ray, CT scan, or examination of the mucus you cough up may also be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTake note that early diagnosis and treatment can slow the progression of the disease. It's key that your healthcare team be involved in this process, as treatment can involve lifestyle changes, medication, respiratory therapy, and in severe cases, surgery.\n\nI recommend you request a spirometry test. Then, if you indeed have COPD, discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider. And remember, the best treatment for COPD starts with quitting smoking (if applicable",
    "34": "Hi. I understand your concerns, and I know this situation is frustrating. Ectopic pregnancy and due to that the removal of tube may have disturbed the menstrual cycle normal pattern. This should normalize over time otherwise you can also take progesterone support for 3-6 cycles. For the headache and fatigue, it's ideal to rule out any nutritional deficiency. For the ovulation to occur properly, along with Clomid you can add on ovulation stimulating hormone injections under your gynecologist's supervision. You also mentioned positive ovulation tests, just beware that they don't detect pregnancy, only the surge of LH hormone indicative of ovulation. It would be ideal to follow up with your gynecologist regarding this. Your clinician might suggest you blood tests for beta HCG to confirm or rule out any early conception. I would also recommend your husband to undergo semen analysis if it hasn’t been done yet. Any form of stress, emotional or physical, can delay your periods,so it’s important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and stay stress-free. Good Luck and do not worry!",
    "35": "It sounds as though your slow heart rate, or bradycardia, could be a residual effect of your ablation for tachycardia. Shortness of breath during warm-up exercises and chest pain at rest are concerning symptoms. The headaches could also be related. Bradycardia, if severe, can cause a decrease in blood flow to the brain and other organs, which can result in a variety of symptoms such as dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting.\n\nIt's important to thoroughly investigate these symptoms as they could potentially indicate that your heart isn't delivering enough oxygen-rich blood to your body. This can be potentially serious and need further management, perhaps with a pacemaker if the bradycardia is symptomatic, and not compensated for during exercise, etc.\n\nYour high blood pressure is another concern. This needs to be controlled to prevent damage to your blood vessels and organs, especially your heart and brain. \n\nThe best course of action would be to seek immediate medical attention and bring these new symptoms to your cardiologist's attention. Your doctor might want to run more tests, such as a Holter monitor, stress test or other heart-imaging tests. Treatment would depend on the cause of your bradycardia and how it affects you.",
    "36": "Hello. Your recurring symptoms point towards inflammatory conditions such as synovitis. This condition results from the inflammation of the joint lining (synovium). However, it would require a physical examination and possibly an ultrasound or MRI for definitive diagnosis. Prednisone, an anti-inflammatory steroid, and Diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), are commonly used for such conditions but, as you've experienced, they can cause stomach upset and ulcers with prolonged use. \n\nSwitching to a newer NSAID (like Etoricoxib, if allowed in your country) or a COX-2 inhibitor may help as they are typically less likely to cause stomach problems. Moreover, you can consider adding a stomach-protecting medication like Proton Pump Inhibitors (Omeprazole, Esomeprazole) to your routine which can help you tolerate the NSAID better. \n\nThe use of topical anti-inflammatory creams (e.g., Diclofenac or Ibuprofen gel) could also help manage the symptoms locally, with less impact on your stomach. \n\nPlease discuss these options with your treating doctor; it is important not to self-medicate, especially with prescription drugs. \n\nPhysical therapy and rest as much as possible while it's inflamed could also be helpful. \n\nAlways remember to take these medications after a meal to reduce the impact on your stomach. \n\nBear in mind, though, that this advice is intended to be",

The only way to confirm it is through an ultrasound of the abdomen or CT scan alongside blood tests such as liver function tests. Your symptoms indicate that you should see your doctor as soon as possible to determine the cause of these new symptoms. If indeed it is an amoebic liver abscess, it can be treated with specific antibiotics for amoebas like metronidazole or tinidazole followed by a luminal (intestinal) agent to eradicate any intestinal infection. Other antibiotics and a possible drainage of the abscess may also be required. Please see your doctor immediately. It's important not to ignore these symptoms.",
    "38": "Hello, and thank you for reaching out. I can understand your concern given your frustrating symptoms. Firstly, these spasms could be the result of numerous conditions, such as muscular issues or, in more severe cases, cardiovascular problems. So I would recommend focusing on lifestyle modifications like maintaining a healthy weight, continuing to abstain from smoking, and stress management.\n\nSecondly, although it is potentially related to anxiety as previously told by your physicians, it worth doing a full cardiac evaluation if you haven't yet. It includes EKG, Echo, and possibly a stress test.

    "39": "Hello, It's understandable that you are worried. If you try to stop yourself from ejaculating, you might cause 'retrograde ejaculation.' That's when the semen goes into your bladder instead of out of your penis. This isn't harmful to your health but it can impact your ability to father a child. \n\nIt's unlikely that stopping ejaculation would cause a problem with achieving an erection, particularly if it happened only once or of and on. It's also unlikely that it would affect just one testicle. The body's reflex is to try to push the testicles up close to the body when you're sexually excited, but it's usually both testicles, not just one. \n\nThe discomfort and the problems with erections might be due to anxiety or stress over this issue, but if these symptoms persist, I would recommend seeing a doctor or a urologist. They will be able to rule out any physical problems and reassess if there's a need for any treatment. \n\nIn general, it's best to let ejaculation happen naturally. Stopping it intentionally isn't generally recommended because it can interfere with the natural process and doesn't have any health benefits.",
    "40": "Hello, thank you for your query. Your semen analysis reports are almost within normal limits. The semen volume is on the lower end of normal (normal range is 1.5 to 5ml). Sperm concentration and motility seem adequate. A higher percentage of rapid progressive motility is usually desired, but your combined total of rapid and moderately progressive motility is 60%, which is reasonable. The presence of 2-4/hpf pus and red cells may indicate an infection or inflammation, so you might want to consult with a urologist. \n\nImproving your health and sperm quality can be achieved through some lifestyle modifications:\n- Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n- Regular exercise improves overall health and aids in healthy sperm production.\n- Prevent overheating your testicles. Prolonged sitting or usage of laptops on your lap, and frequent visits to saunas and hot tubs can increase the temperature on the testicles leading to decreased sperm production.\n- Drink alcohol in moderation and quit smoking.\n- Stay well-hydrated.\n- Get enough of antioxidants and certain vitamins such as Vit C, E, and Coenzyme Q10.\n- Get regular health check-ups and consult your doctor timely.\nRemember, these recommendations are general advice, and it's important to have a discussion with a fertility doctor or urologist to have a tailored plan based on your detailed health history.",
    "41": "Hello, I understand you're going through a challenging situation. It's important to realize that two things may be happening here. First, you may be feeling a lot of anxiety and potentially experiencing symptoms of an anxiety disorder. This could be contributing to the heightened sensitivity and reactions in social situations. Second, it seems that there might be some unresolved anger that might be taking a toll on your psychological well-being. In such cases, seeking help from a mental health professional can be extremely beneficial. They can provide techniques to manage anxiety and address feelings of anger. Mindfulness, relaxation techniques, and cognitive-behavioral therapy can be very helpful. It may also be worthwhile to discuss these symptoms with a neurologist to rule out any neurological issues, given the muscle strain you are experiencing. In any case, seeking help is an important step to recovery. Remember, it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this.

    "46": "I'm really sorry to hear about your brother's situation. It sounds like he's having a tough time, but I'm glad he has you to support him. To answer your question, it should first be noted that autism and schizophrenia are chronic conditions. While there isn't a 'cure' in the traditional sense, there are a variety of strategies and interventions that can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\n\nGiven the medications your brother is currently taking, it seems like he is being treated for both mood symptoms (with Dicorate ER, a mood stabilizer) and psychotic symptoms (with Tryhp plus and Quitipin, both antipsychotics). Frext 50 mg appears to be an antidepressant, which would be used to manage any concurrent depressive symptoms. \n\nIt's essential that he continues to maintain his treatment plan and work with his healthcare team. Managing both autism and schizophrenia can sometimes involve a complex mix of medications, therapeutic techniques (like cognitive-behavioural therapy), and lifestyle adjustments. \n\nIf he's getting agitated, it's crucial to try and determine what might be triggering this. Is it a certain environment, a particular time of day, or a specific activity?

    "47": "Hello, thank you for your question. The symptoms you're describing sounds like it could possibly be a condition known as Pityriasis Rosea, a type of skin rash that often appears on the upper body, including the torso, arms, and shoulders. Pityriasis Rosea usually starts as a large circular or oval spot on your chest, abdomen or back, and then it spreads. The spots can sometimes be itchy. \n\nThere are other possibilities as well, including eczema or some types of dermatitis. \n\nBecause skin conditions can be hard to diagnose without seeing them, and because they can sometimes signal more serious underlying conditions, I would highly recommend you see a dermatologist.

If your current medication, Ropinirole, along with dietary supplements are not providing relief, it may be necessary to consider other treatment options. Options include other dopaminergic drugs or a switch to different types of medication such as benzodiazepines, opioids or antiepileptic drugs for more severe cases. Non-drug treatments may also be beneficial. These can include leg massages, hot baths or heating pads or ice packs applied to the legs, a vibrating pad called Relaxis, and foot wrap devices. Daily physical activity may also help reduce symptoms. \n\nGiven the complexity of treatment options, it would be most appropriate to discuss these options with a healthcare provider who can provide guidance based on severity of symptoms and other aspects of your health.

    "50": "Hello Nikita,\n\nTaking both tablets of Postinor-2 at the same time isn't typically recommended, but it is unlikely to cause any harm or significantly lower the effectiveness of the medication. Postinor-2 or similar \"morning after\" pills are most effective when taken as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours) after unprotected sex. The reason for splitting the dose into two tablets taken 12 hours apart is to prolong the duration of high hormone levels in your body, theoretically giving more protection against unplanned pregnancy.\n\nYou could see some side effects like nausea, vomiting, tender breasts, tiredness, or dizziness. Also, your next menstrual cycle might be lighter or heavier than usual, and you may experience spotting.\n\nDespite this, protection from unplanned pregnancy isn't 100%. If your next period is late by more than a week, please take a pregnancy test to rule out the possibility. Also, remember, Postinor-2 doesn't protect against sexually transmitted infections, so regular use of a condom is advised.\n\nAs for now, there is no need to panic.

It's also worth noting that photosensitivity or place sensitivity due to underlying disease like lupus is also a possibility. Please consult a Dermatologist at your earliest.",
    "68": "The issue your father is experiencing is a sensation of incomplete evacuation, which can indeed be related to the aging process, but could also be a symptom of an underlying medical issue. Conditions such as rectal prolapse or rectocele require further examination to rule them out, and these could be potential surgical issues. These conditions often require the need to manually remove stool from the rectum. \n\nHowever, the need to use his finger may be more of a psychological or habitual issue related to the specific position he uses to pass stool, rather than a medical one. The Indian/Orissa toilet position creates a more natural, gravity-assisted path for stool evacuation, and that's probably why he prefers it. His use of his finger may be an aid or a coping mechanism he has developed over the years.\n\nIt is important to get a full physical examination done by a gastroenterologist. They can evaluate his anorectal function, including sphincter muscle strength and other factors that may be contributing to his condition. This evaluation will help determine the best course of action, whether that involves dietary changes, physical therapy, medication or potential surgery.\n\nPlease remember that without a proper medical examination, it is difficult to diagnose accurately.

    "69": "Well, the symptoms you've mentioned can align with anything from a canker sore to a viral infection. You should first try to carry out some self care measures such as drinking plenty of fluids, avoid hot beverages, smoking, alcohol, and spicy foods. You can carry out salt water gargles and keep a good oral hygiene. If the symptoms persist, you should consider a visit to an ENT specialist to rule out any bacterial or fungal infection, which can be determined by a throat swab. It's also important to have yourself examined if it is affecting your daily routines. Keep in mind, if it is a viral infection, medications will just help alleviate symptoms, your body will recover on its own. In either case, without a physical examination it's hard to diagnose the exact cause. I encourage you to get an appointment with your physician for a comprehensive examination.",

One possibility could be cervical or vaginal infections that can cause irritation and potentially lead to nausea. Another would be the psychological aspect. Sometimes, psychological factors such as anxiety or stress can lead to physical symptoms like the ones you are experiencing.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these are just possibilities. With symptoms such as nausea lasting for such prolonged periods, it is necessary to rule out other conditions like gastrointestinal issues or hormonal imbalances which might be causing these prolonged symptoms. \n\nThe important thing then would be to visit your doctor to get a complete checkup to rule out other causes of nausea. This might involve a physical examination, blood tests, etc. As far as your difficulty in conceiving is concerned, it's recommended that couples try for at least a year before seeking help from a fertility specialist.

Chest pain associated with difficulty breathing can be a symptom of serious conditions like heart disease or a lung condition. Although it might be musculoskeletal or related to heartburn, it's important not to make assumptions about chest pain. Do inform medical professionals about your past medical history and current medication. This could potentially be an emergency situation, so please go to the ER immediately. It's better to be safe when it comes to chest pains.",

Your Prograf (Tacrolimus) levels are being adjusted to prevent over-suppression of the immune system and the potential for drug toxicity. It is normal practice to adjust the dose based on blood levels and your kidney function.\n\nYour potassium level is slightly elevated, but this can be managed through dietary adjustments and medication if necessary. The priority is keeping your kidney function stable, which will in turn keep your potassium level within a safe range. \n\nYour blood pressure is within normal range which is excellent, particularly following a kidney transplant. High blood pressure is a risk for kidney disease, so continue to monitor this.\n\nGiven the information, it doesn't appear that there's a reason for serious concern.

    "74": "Hello, It sounds like your husband may be suffering from a condition known as varicocele, which is essentially varicose veins in the scrotum. This condition can cause discomfort and can potentially affect fertility, though it seems he is already under treatment for sperm count issues. To address the varicocele, there are a few options:\n     \n1. Conservative management: This includes using supportive undergarments or jock straps to provide support and alleviate some of the discomfort.\n\n2. Medical management: There are no specific medicines to treat varicoceles directly.\n\n3. Surgery: Varicocele repair is generally done on an outpatient basis. The surgery basically aims to seal off the affected veins to reroute the blood into normal veins.\n\nThe decision to have surgery will depend on the severity of symptoms, whether there are fertility issues and the size of the varicocele. If you are interested in this option, please speak to your husband's healthcare provider or a urologist. \n\nAs for meanwhile, please continue the advised medication as it will help improve sperm quality, but it may not relieve symptoms associated with varicocele. After all, the most definitive way to address varicocele is surgery.",

West Nile virus often causes neurologic effects including paralysis, muscle weakness, and loss of vision which can often be severe and long-lasting. The recovery from the nerve damage induced by West Nile virus is often slow and may take several months to years, according to the CDC. The time frame for recovery varies greatly and depends on the patient's age, overall health, and the severity of the infection.\n\nCurrently, there is no specific treatment, vaccine or drug for West Nile virus. The primary treatment is supportive and includes physical therapy, pain management, and prevention of complications such as pressure ulcers, urinary tract infection, etc.\n\nIn terms of therapy, it is important to work with a qualified rehabilitation therapist. Physiotherapy may help to strengthen the weak areas and improve balance and coordination, which can aid in walking. Additionally, occupational therapy may provide strategies to improve daily activities.\n\nThe family can help by supporting her emotionally, helping with exercises recommended by the therapists, and ensuring that she is engaging in healthy behaviors such as good nutrition and adequate rest. Emotional support is extremely important in situations like this, as depression and anxiety can often accompany physical illness.\n\nIt can be helpful for your sister to meet with others who have gone through similar experiences.

    "77": "Hello, I'm glad you're seeking treatment for your dental abscess, as such conditions should not be left untreated. If you choose to have the capped molar removed, it might affect how you chew on the right side of your mouth, particularly tougher foods, since you mentioned you have no other molars behind it. Each tooth plays a significant role in the mouth, and its absence can potentially create alignment issues with the remaining teeth over time. However, people adapt differently and you may find that with time, you adjust to the change. This is something you should definitely discuss with your dentist, considering all the pros and cons, before making a final decision.",

It is characterized by widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin. It can occur as a reaction to a drug, or as a complication of a pre-existing skin disease, or due to an underlying systemic disease. Patients with this condition usually present with generalized redness, scaling, and often with itching, fever, and malaise. Given the patient's history of gouty arthritis, it's possible that the dermatitis is a reaction to medication used for treating the arthritis. An urgent consultation with a dermatologist is recommended for further examination and targeted treatment.",
    "79": "Hello, based on your information, it seems like you got a small prick from a used syringe. Generally, the risk of infection from something like this is very low, especially since the syringe had been used by your father, with whom you likely share similar microbes. However, if there was any blood left in the syringe from your father, there could potentially be a risk of bloodborne infections if your father has any. Diabetes itself is not contagious and can't be transferred by a needle prick. \n\nYou did the right thing by making note of any blood. If you washed the area with soap and water immediately after noticing this, you've done a good job in preventing infection. If you notice signs of infection such as redness, swelling, pus discharge or if the area becomes warm, please seek immediate medical attention. \n\nFor future, I would recommend being very careful around used syringes. Try not to handle them if you don't need to and always point the needle away from you.",

These medications do not typically cause back pain as a side effect, though everyone can react to medications differently. \n\nIt's also important to consider factors such as posture, heavy lifting, physical activity, and ergonomics of your work station, which could all contribute to back pain. If the back pain persists or worsens, I recommend you book an appointment with your primary healthcare provider to evaluate further. \n\nWith regards to the medications, it's essential to take those medications exactly as prescribed, given their role in managing high blood pressure. Any changes to your medications should always be discussed with your doctor.\n\nIf the pain is severe or if you have other symptoms such as fever, difficulty urinating, or unexplained weight loss, you should seek immediate medical attention.",
    "81": "Hello, please be reassured that the most common reason for these lumps, particularly in children, is due to enlarged lymph nodes. The lymph nodes can be enlarged due to an ongoing infection, such as a sore throat, dental issues, or even just a common cold. The fact that they are mobile and you can move them around with your fingers is also typically characteristic of lymph nodes.\n\nIt's great that you have already seen her pediatrician and that tests have returned negative. But, it's important to have a follow-up. Signs to watch out for would be if the lymph nodes keep getting larger in size, if they become very firm, and can't be moved around, or if your child develops unexplained symptoms like sustained fever, weight loss, night sweats, etc. \n\nDon't hesitate to revisit your pediatrician for another examination if these lumps persist or if other symptoms develop.

    "82": "I'm really sorry to hear about your father's situation. Ascites, or accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, can be a complication of Chronic Liver Disease (CLD), as well as of certain types of cancer including lung cancer. As you've seen, draining the ascites can temporarily provide relief but can cause side effects like dehydration. Increasing the dose of Lasix, a diuretic medication, can help to reduce the fluid build-up, but its effect can vary and it may not be enough to manage severe cases.\n\nIn patients who do not respond well to diuretics and who are not good candidates for a liver transplant, there are some other treatment options that can be considered. One of them is placement of a shunt, or tube, that can divert the fluid from the abdomen to other parts of the body where it can be absorbed. This is known as a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.\n\nAnother option is the use of certain types of medication (like octreotide or midodrine) that can help to reduce the production of ascites or increase its absorption. \n\nAlso, it's important to make sure your father is eating a low-salt diet, as excess salt can worsen fluid build-up.\n\nIt might also be beneficial to consult with a hospice or palliative care service. They specialize in providing care and enhancing comfort for patients with serious illnesses. Of course, the choice of treatment would depend",

It's also concerning that your gums are described as \"vulnerable\" and your bleeding is hard to stop. Your orthodontist's recommendation that the procedure be performed in a hospital setting is likely due to the potential for complications and the need for more advanced care and equipment.\n\nThis is going to be the safest approach for you. Surgery in a hospital setting ensures that, should there be heavy bleeding or any other complications, you'll have immediate access to specialized care. The surgical team will be able to manage your bleeding and ensure that everything goes as smoothly as possible.\n\nRemember it's important to fully discuss any concerns you have with your surgeon or dentist before the procedure, including recovery time, pain management and any possible complications.

    "85": "Hello. Given that you used a condom during intercourse and had a negative pregnancy test at 10 days late, it is less likely that you are pregnant. The bloating, aches, and a delayed period can also come from other conditions such as stress, hormonal fluctuations, changes in weight or exercise habits, dietary changes, or issues related to the ovaries or uterus.\n\nIf you are consistently having protected sex and are not using any other form of contraception (like birth control pills or IUD), it might be worth speaking to your healthcare provider to discuss other contraception options and to evaluate what could be causing your delayed period and other symptoms. In the meantime, if you are sexually active and don't wish to become pregnant, continue to use protection consistently.\n\nYou could also repeat a pregnancy test to be sure, as sometimes it may take a bit longer for the hormone hCG to be detected on a urine test.

However, if the pain doesn't subside, continues to worsen, or you have difficulty breathing, you should immediately seek medical attention. You may need imaging such as an x-ray or ultrasound to rule out any serious injuries.  Meanwhile, avoid movements that worsen the pain, use over-the-counter painkillers as needed, apply ice to the area, and try not to sleep on the injured side. This should give you some relief.",

Given your history and the duration and severity of your current pain, I would advise you to see a spine specialist or neurosurgeon. They may recommend an MRI scan to determine the current state of your back and help pinpoint the source of your pain.\n\nYour doctor may also consider recommending physical therapy, lifestyle alterations, medication management, injections, and surgery as part of your treatment. Surgery is usually considered a last resort, after all other treatment options have been explored and if your quality of life is significantly affected.\n\nRegarding your question about Laser Surgery, in spine surgery, it is typically used to remove a portion of the herniated disc that is pressing on a nerve, leading to pain and potentially other symptoms. It's less invasive than other types of surgery, which might lead to quicker recovery times. However, not everyone is a good candidate for this type of surgery.\n\nBefore pursuing any treatment, it is crucial that you have a full understanding of your diagnosis and the risks and benefits of each treatment option. I would recommend discussing this in detail with your physician or a spine specialist. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns.",

However, they could also be related to your recent hemorrhoid issue as hemorrhoids can sometimes cause skin tags, which might feel like bumps. Both can be worsened by things like moisture, friction, and poor ventilation in the anal area. Keep clean the area and maybe avoid wearing thongs until this clears up.

Irritation of nerves, such as the intercostal nerves that run along the rib cage, is also a possibility. However, this would typically cause pain along the rib line, rather than just in one spot. Another possibility is gastritis or ulcer. This needs a proper clinical evaluation and investigations such as an ultrasound, endoscopy or CT scan depending on your symptoms and signs.

Hydrocortisone cream: This is available over-the-counter and can reduce inflammation and itching.\n\n3. Warm compress: A warm compress can help soothe razor bumps and ingrown hairs.\n\n4. Topical antibiotics: Many pharmacies carry topical creams or ointments that contain antibiotics.\n\n5. Exfoliate: Gently exfoliate the area before shaving to remove dead skin cells and help prevent ingrown hairs.\n\nAs for the bumps that have grown a little and stayed there for years, these may need to be assessed by a healthcare professional. They could be cysts, warts, or something else that requires medical intervention. I understand your concern about the cost, but it's important to check this out. Many health clinics offer sliding scale fees based on income, or you may be able to find a low-cost clinic in your area. \n\nRemember not to pick at or try to pop these bumps since it can lead to scarring or infection.\n\nHope these tips are helpful!

    "93": "Hello, thank you for your query. Information on the use of dental materials might be difficult to find online, due to its technical and specialized nature. However, as per the American Dental Association and most recognized dental institutions, stainless steel crowns are commonly used for primary or \"baby\" teeth, especially when they are decayed to the point they cannot hold a filling. \n\nAluminum crowns are an older dental restoration that has been largely replaced by more durable and aesthetically pleasing materials such as ceramic and porcelain. While it's not strictly true that aluminum is never used in adult mouths, it is considerably less common due to its lower strength and less natural appearance. \n\nThere's no absolute rule in dental science that forbids the use of aluminum crowns in adults, but modern practice and standards favor other materials. I would recommend seeking a second opinion from another dental professional if you have concerns about the standard of care you have received. Also, you may wish to consult with a dental malpractice attorney if you feel that the services you received were not as represented. I hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck.",

For temporary relief, you could try heat application and over-the-counter pain management measures, but you should be careful to avoid self-medicating for long periods. Furthermore, it’s important to follow up with your doctor based on their recommendations. You might also need to consult with a specialist, such as a cardiologist or a gastroenterologist, depending on your associated symptoms.",
    "105": "Hello Victoria. I understand your situation. The pain you describe, especially localized to the Right Lower Quadrant, could indeed represent appendicitis but there are also other potential causes, like ovarian cysts, kidney stones or even urinary tract infections. Without full examination it would be hard to determine, but observing how your pain evolves in a few hours could provide valuable information. As a CT tech, you know that imaging can often be very helpful in this sort of situation. Since you're at work, and if your symptoms persist, please do bring it up to the ER doctor, as you have the right to be evaluated fully. Please don't ignore your pain, the sooner a potential issue is addressed, the better. If it does end up being appendicitis, a prompt treatment could lead to a faster recovery and hopefully not impede your vacation plans.",
    "106": "Hello, thank you for reaching out.\n\nDespite your surgery having taken place some time ago, the two persisting openings that continue to drain fluid are of concern. Incomplete wound healing can be due to a variety of reasons including chronic infection, poor local wound care, or underlying health issues such as diabetes or poor general health and nutritional status.\n\nYou should have the condition evaluated by a medical professional. They may perform tests to identify causative bacteria and determine the appropriate antibiotic regimen for you. Sometimes, further surgical intervention to clear the wound of non-healing tissue or foreign material can be necessary. \n\nAlso, local wound care is key. You should continue to keep these areas clean and dry as best as possible, practicing good hygiene and changing dressings as instructed.\n\nPlease don't delay seeking medical attention. The guidance here is only general, and a personal consultation with a doctor will provide you more accurate management. Take care.",
    "107": "Hello. The \"left ventricular configuration\" typically refers to the size and shape of the lower left chamber of your heart, the left ventricle. This part of your heart is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood from the lungs out to the rest of your body. A change in configuration could be a sign of a number of different heart conditions, but you would want to speak with a cardiologist for details, based on your particular case.\n\n\"Mild unfolding of the aorta\" typically refers to a normal age-related change where the aorta – the main blood vessel branching off the heart – becomes more curved or 'buckled'. It is generally not a serious condition, but it can sometimes be associated with conditions such as high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, or connective tissue disorders. You should discuss this finding further with your doctor or seek a consultation with a cardiologist.\n\nPlease note, these are only observations on the X-ray, and they need correlation with clinical examination and other tests. Does not always necessarily indicate disease. Clinical judgement of a doctor is very essential in interpreting Xray findings.",
    "108": "Hello, \n\nIt's quite normal for a healthy couple to take up to a year to conceive. It can take time for nature to follow its course, even when everything is perfectly healthy. There are a few things that you can do. Make sure you're having sexual intercourse regularly - ideally every 2 to 3 days without waiting for specific ovulation days. You can also start tracking your ovulation if you haven't done so yet. You can use an ovulation predictor kit or monitor your monthly cycle closely. \n\nMaintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and keep stress levels low. Importantly, as I mentioned, even couples without any health issues may take time to conceive - up to a year is normal, and even longer can be common. If you are still concerned, you may want to speak to a fertility specialist who can provide further advice and treatment if necessary.   \n\nPlease don't worry too much, give it some time and keep trying. All the best.",
    "109": "Hello, I understand your concerns. Snoring in children can sometimes be a sign of an issue known as sleep apnea, which is when breathing stops temporarily during sleep. It's most commonly caused by enlarged tonsils and adenoids blocking the upper airway. However, if your ENT specialist has examined her and found nothing concerning, it could also be related to allergies, a cold, or even the way her neck is positioned during sleep.\n\nTry to monitor her sleep a bit more closely if you can. Note if she's constantly snoring every night or if it's intermittent. Also, look for pauses in her breathing, heavy breathing, difficulty breathing, or gasping sounds. If her snoring is impacting her sleep (i.e. she seems tired during the day), or if she exhibits any of the above symptoms, it might be a good idea to seek a second opinion.\n\nFrom a non-medical standpoint, if she's overweight or obese, helping her to lose weight could help reduce snoring. Also, removing allergens from her environment, such as dust or pet dander, can improve snoring if she is allergic.\n\nLastly, remember it's okay to get a second medical opinion if you're worried. Her health and your peace of mind are paramount.",
    "110": "Hello Zourab,\n\nChest pain can be caused by a variety of conditions, and not all of them are related to the heart or lungs. Since your doctor has ruled out any problems with your heart and lungs, your chest pain might be due to conditions such as:\n\n1. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) - where stomach acids flow back up into your esophagus, causing pain.\n2. Esophageal disorders, including spasms or inflammation of the esophagus\n3. Gallbladder or pancreas problems\n4. Musculoskeletal issues, like costochondritis (inflammation of cartilage near the ribs) or muscle strain\n\nIt's important to continue to communicate with your doctor about your symptoms, especially if they persist or become worse, so that a proper diagnosis can be made. Further diagnostic tests may be required to determine the exact cause of your pain. Please, do not ignore persistent or severe chest pain. \n\nBest Regards.",
    "111": "Thanks for your question. Fibrolinear densities in the lungs are typically seen in chest X-rays and usually represent scar tissue from previous infections or injuries, such as tuberculosis or pneumonia. In your case, since you have already undergone treatment for TB, these densities are likely to be residual scars of that previous infection. Once TB is treated, healed lesions can leave behind fibrotic scars which might show up on X-rays. \n\nHowever, if these lesions are new or you have any symptoms like cough, loss of weight, loss of appetite, night sweats, or hemoptysis (coughing up blood), it could indicate a new or recurrent infection, and additional diagnostic tests such as CT scan, sputum culture or biopsy might be required.\n\nTherefore, if you're not having any symptoms, it's likely your previous TB infection has left behind some scars in your lungs which are showing on the X-ray. But, if you're symptomatic, I'd advise you to return to your doctor for further assessment. Also, keep in mind that regular follow-up with your doctor is crucial in maintaining your overall health, especially as you have a history of TB. Please don't hesitate to seek care if you notice any new or worsening symptoms. I hope this helps!",
    "112": "Hello, based on what you've told me, it seems like you might be experiencing some of the common symptoms of early pregnancy such as dizziness, fatigue, increased frequency of urination, and headaches. The one purple line on your pregnancy test can indicate that the test was negative, as usually two lines indicate a positive result. However, different brands have different ways of displaying results, so it's important to double-check the instructions. If you have doubts, I would recommend retesting with a new pregnancy test in a few days or getting a blood test at your doctor's clinic for more accurate results.",
    "113": "I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing these issues. Your symptoms are concerning and potentially serious. The difficulty breathing and sensation of a lump in your stomach could be due to a variety of causes, some of which may be related to your recent heart surgery. Given your history and the quick onset of these symptoms occurring with exertion, this could potentially be a heart-related issue or perhaps related to fluid build up in the body. It could also potentially be unrelated to your heart, and due to some gastrointestinal issue or a respiratory issue like COPD (if you're a smoker or have had long-term exposure to lung irritants). \n\nIt's important you seek immediate medical attention to discuss these symptoms, especially the shortness of breath with exertion. Please don't delay speaking with your healthcare provider or consider going to the emergency room if you feel your condition worsens. In the meantime, try to take it easy and avoid anything strenuous to not exacerbate your symptoms. Do not ignore these symptoms and please seek medical help right away. \n",
    "114": "Hello. The size of the boot is important for stability and comfort. If the boot is too loose, it might not provide enough support for your foot, and if it's too tight, it could cause discomfort or affect blood circulation. Ideally, the boot should fit snugly while still allowing your toes to move. However, a slight discrepancy in size, as long as it's not causing discomfort, shouldn't affect the healing process significantly. If it's too large and your foot is moving too much inside, or too tight causing discomfort, then it's recommended you return to the hospital and have it checked and possibly replaced with a better fitting one. Always consult with your healthcare provider in such cases.",
    "115": "I'm sorry to hear that your daughter is unwell. First of all, please make sure to keep an open line with your primary care physician or pediatrician regarding medication administration. Cheratussin is a cough suppressant that may provide temporary relief. However, it's extremely important to use caution with cough and cold medications in young children due to potential side effects. \n\nAdditionally, in asthma, the key issue is often inflammation and bronchospasm (tightening of the muscles around the airways), which a cough suppressant alone does not address. If your daughter's cough is due to an asthma flare-up, your doctor may consider stepping up her asthma maintenance therapy temporarily - for example, by increasing the dose or frequency of inhaled corticosteroids, or by adding oral corticosteroids.\n\nHer continuous cough and lack of response to her usual albuterol treatments suggest that her asthma may not be well-controlled at the moment. You should consult with her pediatrician or an asthma specialist as soon as possible. Don't delay emergency care if you notice signs of increasing distress, like rapid breathing, retractions (the skin sucking in with each breath), bluish lips or face, or if she is not able to eat, drink or talk normally due to shortness of breath.",

Causes could range from urinary tract infection, kidney stones, gastrointestinal disorders like gastritis, peptic ulcers, gall bladder issues to ovarian cysts or other gynecological conditions. Given the range of possibilities and the complexity of your symptoms, it is important not just to rely on online advice. It's advisable to see a healthcare provider for a full assessment, including a physical exam and possibly some tests like an Ultrasound, blood tests, Urine analysis to pinpoint the cause. In the meantime, try to rest and hydrate well. If the pain becomes severe or you develop a high fever, please head to the emergency department immediately.",
    "117": "Hello Anurag, based on your description it sounds like these new lumps might be molluscum contagiosum, a type of skin infection, or possibly warts spreading from the original site. Both of these conditions are typically caused by a virus and can spread through direct skin-to-skin contact or indirectly by touching an object that has the virus on it. Sexual transmission may occur with genital cases.\n\nKeep these areas clean, avoid scratching or touching them as much as possible, and don't share towels or other personal items. Also, avoid sexual contact until you've received further advice or treatment from your doctor.\n\nIt's important to get these new lumps checked by a healthcare professional. They can potentially remove or treat these lesions, which is recommended to stop them from spreading further. Please arrange an appointment with a dermatologist or urologist for a definitive diagnosis and treatment. It's also important to ensure the antibiotic and ivermectin treatment effectively addressed your initial problem.",

From your description, it seems your child has been struggling with repeated infections, and her high CRP (C-Reactive Protein) level, Leucocyte count, and Neutrophils percentage are all indicative of an ongoing inflammation or infection in her body. The fact that she had a liver abscess and a UTI in the past could suggest that her immune system might be having trouble fighting off infections. The +++ blood could also be a sign of a urinary tract infection, especially since she's had this problem before.\n\nI suggest a detailed investigation to identify the underlying cause of these recurring symptoms, possibly including a full urine examination, sensitivity tests to identify which antibiotics work best for her, kidney function tests, and immune function tests. In the meantime, maintain her hydration and nutrition status well.\n\nThis is merely an internet-based advice, and you should consult her pediatrician for a more accurate diagnosis and treatment. \n\nThank you for reaching out.",
    "120": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Changing color of phlegm usually indicates an ongoing respiratory infection. Your body is trying to clear out the infection and the color changes can be a sign that your body is succeeding or that the infection is becoming more significant. It would be advisable to consult a healthcare provider if these symptoms persist, as you may need antibiotics or further investigation. \n\nIf the symptoms are not severe, some at-home treatments include remaining well-hydrated, using a humidifier, resting to aid your immune system, and avoiding irritants such as smoke.\n\nHowever, green, yellow or brown phlegm, especially when accompanied by fever, breathlessness, chest pain or other worsening symptoms, should always be evaluated by a medical professional. \n\nIf you have been unwell for five days with changing phlegm color and it's not improving, it's a good idea to make an appointment with your healthcare provider to assess the situation and determine if you need treatment.

    "121": "Hello, I understand the difficulty and stress you're experiencing right now. Given your CA 125 levels are rising and you have enlargement of the liver, it is indeed advisable to get a further medical consultation. Your CA 125 levels tend to increase in ovarian cancer but there are other conditions which also cause CA 125 to increase such as endometriosis, menstruation, and liver disease. As such, it may not always solely indicate the progression of cancer. I would suggest you to consult with your oncologist, who can guide you on whether you need additional chemotherapy or other therapies.\n\nA PET scan can be very useful in your case since it can show how tissues and organs are functioning. However, as you mentioned that it is not available in Sri Lanka, travelling abroad to get it done might be an option subject to current COVID-19 international travel restrictions.\n\nAdyar Cancer Institute in Chennai, India is a well-known cancer institute and there, you could potentially get both a PET scan and consultation with experienced oncologists. For this, you would need to reach out to the institution directly to arrange it. They should be able to guide you through the process including any potential international patient services.\n\nIt's important to discuss all of your options with a healthcare professional who has access to your medical history.

    "123": "Hello, It's important to manage high blood pressure to avoid potential complications like heart disease or stroke. Blood pressure of 150/90 is indeed considered high. If you are frequently seeing readings of 180/100, this is very high and should be addressed immediately. Lifestyle changes can help lower blood pressure, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, reducing sodium and alcohol, and quit smoking if you do. However, if lifestyle changes aren't enough, yes, medication may be necessary.\n\nStarting medication doesn't necessarily mean you'll be on it for life. Some people can manage their blood pressure with lifestyle changes alone after being on medication for some time, but this should always be under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Regular check-ups and monitoring your blood pressure will be very important if you start medication therapy. But remember, every case is unique and the decision should be made with your doctor.\n\nIn the meantime, if your blood pressure is often 180/100 and especially if you experience symptoms like severe headache, fatigue or confusion, chest pain, difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, you should seek immediate medical attention.",

The \"fizzing\" sensation in your head, coupled with the pain in your left eye and nasal congestion, may be due to inflammation and mucus build-up within your sinuses. Tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, can sometimes be associated with sinus problems as well. \n\nHowever, if you've repeatedly tried medication with little or no improvement, it's possible that there could be some underlying issue other than just allergies or sinusitis, such as a deviated septum, nasal polyps or even a more serious condition like a brain disorder. It's crucial to have a more thorough evaluation to rule out these potential issues. Consult with an ENT specialist or neurologist, who may recommend further diagnostic testing like an MRI or CT scan, allergy testing, or an endoscopy of your nasal passages. They can provide more targeted treatment options based on these results. Please do not ignore these symptoms and seek medical attention as soon as possible.",

Considering this was your third miscarriage, it is recommended that you and your partner undergo a full evaluation, including karyotyping (chromosome analysis for you and your husband), antiphospholipid antibody testing, and possibly a uterine evaluation (an ultrasound or hysterosalpingogram) if this hasn't been done. \n\nAs for your AMH level, 1.0 is a good level for trying to conceive, as it indicates a fair ovarian reserve. However, the decision between natural conception and IVF should be made based on your doctor's recommendations. IVF may allow enhanced embryo selection and genetic testing of embryos before transferring to the uterus, hence potentially decreasing the chance of another miscarriage, but it is a more invasive and expensive procedure.\n\nIt would be advisable to have a more in-depth conversation with your fertility specialist or OBGYN about the risks and benefits of each approach considering your specific circumstances.

I would recommend, if possible, that you visit an oral medicine specialist or a dentist who specializes in oral diseases. They would be best suited to evaluate your condition and determine the underlying cause of your persistent mouth sores. Meanwhile, try to maintain good oral hygiene, avoid spicy and acidic foods that can irritate your sores, and keep yourself hydrated.

Foods rich in protein, vitamins A, B, C, D, and E, zinc and biotin can promote hair healthy growth. \n\nI recommend continuing to monitor your hormonal levels and working closely with your doctor to manage it.

Increase your intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein like chicken breast, fish, tofu, etc. Cut down on junk, processed, and fried food. \n\n2. Exercise: Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling, 5 times a week.\n\n3. Hydration: Stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. This will help flush out toxins from the body and keep your liver functioning properly.\n\n4. Alcohol: If you consume alcohol, further limit your intake or consider stopping it completely.\n\n5. Weight: Your body weight is higher than recommended for your height.

It is important you get this checked out by your doctor, ideally a gynaecologist.\n\nYour facial spots could be caused by hormonal changes, which are common in women around your age as they approach menopause. However, it could also be a sign of an underlying health condition, so again, it's worth reporting these symptoms to your doctor.\n\nFinally, stress and lethargy can be a symptom of numerous health issues, both physical and mental.

Ibuprofen is good for pain and inflammation but it's important to ensure you're following the recommended dosages. \n\nAs for cyclobenzaprine, it's a muscle relaxant and could potentially help with muscle spasm. However, it also can cause drowsiness and dry mouth. Please note, it is not recommended to mix ibuprofen and cyclobenzaprine without your doctor's advice.\n\nFalling and subsequent physical stress can lead to an increase in body temperature. This might explain your feeling of feverish. The weakness and dizziness post the fall could be due to pain and anxiety from the fall rather than an actual head injury.\n\nApplying heat or ice can help with your back pain. In the initial 24-48 hours after an injury, you should ideally use ice to help minimize inflammation, and after that you can use heat to help with stiffness and pain.\n\nIf your discomfort and symptoms continue, or if they get worse, please get medical attention. Even with a back fall, it's possible that you've sustained an internal injury that might need medical attention.",
    "141": "Hello. It sounds like your symptoms could be due to irritation or slight trauma from unlubricated sex. You can try applying an over-the-counter topical antibiotic ointment for a few days to see if this helps with the discomfort and speeds healing. Avoid sexual activity until the irritation has fully healed to prevent further injury. Drinking plenty of water to dilute the urine may also lessen stinging when you urinate. If the symptoms don't improve, definitely see a healthcare provider to rule out any potential infections. In the future, using a lubricant could help to prevent this type of irritation.",
    "142": "Hello Rashi, \n\nI'm sorry to hear about your issue with hair loss. Hair loss can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal imbalances, stress, nutritional deficiencies and, as you've mentioned, change in environmental factors such as water and climate.\n\nIn your case, it seems the change in water could be a critical factor. Pune's water could be hard with a significant amount of minerals, which may be harmful for your hair. If it's possible, you might consider installing a water-softening unit at your home or at least using filtered water for hair wash. \n\nYou could also try using a mild shampoo, and do remember not to wash hair daily as it strips natural oils from your scalp leading to dryness and increased fall. You can also apply oils rich in Vitamin E, such as almond or avocado oil, to your scalp regularly to nourish your roots and hair shafts.\n\nFurther, ensure you're consuming a balanced diet with plenty of lean protein, vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables, and healthy fats. Biotin, iron, and other vitamins can contribute to hair health. Also, try to minimize stress through yoga, meditation or other relaxation techniques.\n\nIf you've tried these suggestions and the hair loss continues, it might be worth a consultation with a dermatologist in-person, which will give you opportunity for a complete scalp examination and advice tailored to your needs.",
    "143": "Hi, I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing chronic abdominal pain. In addition to visible sutures, the pain could be possibly due to adhesions or scar tissue in your abdomen, often a result of previous surgeries. These adhesions can cause chronic discomfort or pain, although it's usually not the first cause that springs to mind for most health professionals. There are unfortunately no good imaging studies to identify adhesions - they typically aren't discovered until another surgery is done in the same general area. I suggest discussing the possibility of adhesions with your doctor. It may also be beneficial to get a second opinion from another gastroenterologist or surgeon. Pain management may be important in your case as well, since your sleep is being interrupted regularly.",
    "144": "The correct statement is: Alpha and gamma motor neurons are activated at the same time (Option c). The co-activation of alpha and gamma motor neurons is known as \"alpha-gamma co-activation\", which ensures that the muscle spindle maintains the sensitivity to stretch during muscle contraction. This cooperation between alpha and gamma motor neurons is crucial for our nervous system to consistently monitor muscle length and speed.",
    "145": "Hello, from your description, the lump on your penis head could be many things. It might possibly be a cyst, an inflamed hair follicle, or could be an irritation from friction or from a product you or your wife may have used. Skin conditions, such as psoriasis, also can cause skin changes on the penis. However, without seeing it, it's hard to make a specific diagnosis. It's good news that it doesn't hurt or itch, which are usually signs of an infection or STD. Since it's causing you concern, I would advise you to make an appointment with your doctor who can examine it properly and give you a confirmatory diagnosis. Please ensure to always maintain good hygiene and use lubricants if you experience any dryness or friction during intercourse.",
    "146": "Hi, \n\nIt sounds like your son might be dealing with a viral infection like the flu or a cold, especially considering his symptoms - fever, dizziness, feeling hot and cold (chills), headache, cough, and sore throat. These are all common symptoms of such an infection. \n\nThe management you're currently following is appropriate for symptomatic relief. Keeping him hydrated and ensuring he gets plenty of rest will also help as his body fights off the viral infection. It's crucial to monitor his symptoms and if his condition worsens or if he develops high fever or difficulty breathing, he should be taken to a healthcare provider immediately. \n\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic also calls for considering a test for your son due to the overlapping symptoms. If the symptoms persist or aggravate over the next few days or if any new symptoms arise, you should seek medical attention.\n\nPlease follow local health guidelines for managing illnesses during the pandemic. If anyone else in the household has similar symptoms, they should also get tested. \n\n(Note: The information provided is intended to give a general overview and may not include specific factors that might be affecting your son's health. It's always best to discuss with a healthcare provider for a complete evaluation and treatment.)",
    "147": "Hello. After IUI, the first signs of pregnancy can seem fairly similar to the symptoms of an impending period. However, usually these feelings such as backache and dizziness start about a week to ten days after IUI. Post-IUI, you generally wait for two weeks before taking a pregnancy test, as hCG (the pregnancy hormone) needs some time to build up. This time period is usually referred to as the \"two-week wait\". While symptoms can vary for each woman, common early symptoms of pregnancy include spotting and cramping, breast changes, fatigue, nausea, missed periods, and frequent urination. Remember, a pregnancy test after IUI treatment is the most dependable way to tell if the procedure was successful. All the best!",
    "148": "Hello, \n\nFrom your provided echocardiography report, the left atrial size is mildly dilated, overall left ventricular functions are good with an ejection fraction of 58%. There is mention of hypokinesia of the inferior wall, suggesting that portion of your heart muscle isn't contracting as well as the rest; this is likely due to a previous heart attack or blockage of the blood supply in an area of your heart. \n\nAs for the Doppler findings, there is mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild aortic regurgitation - both things are pretty common and usually nothing of concern unless severe. There seems to be no issue with the replaced mitral valve which is a good sign.\n\nFor medication, I can't make specific suggestions without further detail, but usually patients with your history would be on medications like beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Though, you should continue your regular follow-ups with your cardiologist and take a medication under his guidance. \n\nYour full evaluation, including other lab work and physical exam, would be needed to make the best judgment about your overall heart health.",
    "149": "Hello, Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOD) is one of the common causes of infertility. Ovigyn DSR is a combination of Clomifene/Clomiphene and Ubidecarenone which helps in the treatment of female infertility. Clomifene/Clomiphene works by stimulating the release of eggs from the ovary (ovulation). Ubidecarenone is an antioxidant which can help in improving egg quality and maturation. Nactab helps in regularising your menstrual cycle. \n\nWhile it's hard to say exactly when you would be able to conceive as it varies from person to person, typically with medication and lifestyle modifications, many women with PCOD are able to conceive. It may take a few cycles of treatment, if you do not see results in 3-6 months, reach out to your doctor to possibly reassess your treatment plan. \n\nRemember to maintain a healthy lifestyle, regular exercise and a balanced diet, as they significantly help in managing PCOD symptoms and increase chances of conception. Keep a positive mindset and do not stress as stress can further complicate matters. May you be fruitful soon, stay healthy!",
    "150": "Hello, while mineral supplements can help support health, they're not intended to replace traditional medical treatment for conditions like Sjogren's syndrome or colon cancer. It's also important to note that excessive consumption of certain supplements can be harmful.\n\nMineral supplements should be specific to the individual's needs. If you or your nephew are lacking certain minerals in your diets, it may be helpful to supplement them. However, it's crucial to speak with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement, as they can interfere with medications or have side effects. \n\nIf you're considering ionic mineral supplements, look for products that have been independently tested by organizations like U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), NSF International, or Consumer Lab. These organizations test for things like ingredient accuracy and presence of contaminants.\n\nAlpha Health Support has a variety of mineral supplements available, but you should also consider other trusted brands. Always communicate with your healthcare provider about your intention to use these supplements. They can provide guidance on appropriate and safe use.",
    "151": "Hello, your daughter's symptoms could be indicative of a viral illness, such as roseola or another viral exanthem, especially if the rashes appeared after the fever. The change in stool color could possibly be related to a change in diet or from the virus itself. However, given her Down Syndrome, she could be more susceptible to certain illnesses. It's possible that the rash, fever and the change in stool color might be different parts of the same infectious process, but they might also be unrelated. Please let her pediatrician know about all these symptoms, because they know her medical history well and can give you the most accurate diagnosis.",

Gallbladder problems, like gallstones, can indeed cause pain that radiates to the back. It is important to get timely treatment. \n\nIf your pain is worsening despite at-home remedies, and you feel unable to manage until your appointment, I'd recommend going to the ER, especially if the pain is severe, if you have fever, vomiting or your skin/eyes become yellow. These could be signs of complications which need immediate attention, such as gallbladder inflammation, infection, or a blocked bile duct. It's always better to be safe in cases like this.",
    "153": "The orange color of the stool might be due to your diet or a certain medications or supplements you’re taking. Certain foods and medications can change the color of the stool. However, chronic loose, orange and gurgling stomach could be indicative of malabsorption issues such as disorders affecting the bile ducts or biliary system in the liver which produces bile. Bile salts are needed to give stool its brown color, and also for digestion. \n\nIf you have eaten foods that are orange in color, like carrots, it could be a food-related cause. Otherwise, it can also be due to decreased bile salts or slowed down transit of food and waste materials in the gut. This is usually seen in diarrhea cases, celiac disease, IBS, and some liver diseases.\n\nThere are home remedies such as over-the-counter antacids, activated charcoal capsules, probiotics that might help. But it's best to get medical attention, your doctor might need to order blood tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy or a sigmoidoscopy based on the physical examination findings.

While the heart rate can rise due to stress, dehydration, fever or other reasons, it should come down when those issues are addressed.\n\nIn her case, as she's experiencing chest pains along with a high heart rate and having background of diabetes which increases her risk for heart disease, it would be prudent to seek medical attention promptly. Her appointments are quite far off, waiting until then given the symptoms she's experiencing could create potential problems if indeed she has a heart condition that is ongoing. Please do not delay in seeking help.",
    "155": "Hello, this sounds like a condition termed dermatitis, which is inflammation of the skin. Your symptoms suggest a type called \"contact dermatitis\" which could be due to exposure to certain substances such as detergents, cosmetics, jewelry or plants which can cause skin inflammation, redness and itching. \n\nHowever, it's also very important to consider other conditions like an allergic reaction or even systemic diseases that can cause skin rashes. The pins and needles sensation you feel could be due to inflammation and irritation of the nerves. \n\nI would recommend you to urgently see a dermatologist or your primary doctor for an in-person evaluation as you need an accurate diagnosis. You might be prescribed topical or oral steroids for the inflammation and antihistamines for the itchiness. \n\nIt's crucial to identify and avoid the causative agent if it's contact dermatitis. Substances such as petrolatum or lanolin can help to protect skin. If you find your symptoms worsening or you develop difficulty breathing, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nPlease note: The information I have provided is based on what you have told me and doesn't replace the need for a consultation and examination by a healthcare professional.",
    "156": "Hello, I understand your concern. If a dog has licked you, but there was no broken skin or open wound on your finger, the risk for transmission is nearly nonexistent. The rabies virus is transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal, and it requires an entry point, usually a bite or a scratch, or contact with mucous membranes like the eye or mouth. Licking over intact skin doesn’t cause rabies transmission.\n\nAs for the yeast infection, it is typically caused by the overgrowth of a fungus called Candida, and it usually has nothing to do with your immune system fighting off a viral infection like rabies. Factors that can increase your risk of a yeast infection include antibiotic use, a weakened immune system, stress, lack of sleep, and hormonal changes.\n\nHowever, if you're really concerned, you can consult a healthcare provider. In general, people who come into contact with potentially rabid animals and get licked over intact skin are not advised to have post-exposure prophylaxis (rabies vaccines after exposure). \n\nRemember to wash your hands regularly and try to avoid direct contact with animals, especially if you're traveling in areas where rabies is known to be a problem.",
    "157": "Hello, It sounds like you have taken precautions to prevent pregnancy. The I-pill was used correctly within 24 hours of unprotected sex, and then you used a condom for your subsequent time. Both are effective ways to prevent pregnancy. The pill can sometimes cause changes in your menstrual cycle. It is not uncommon for the period to be late or early after taking the I-pill, and sometimes it may even cause heavier or lighter periods. Additionally, stress can also impact your menstrual cycle. If you do not get your period within a week or so, or if you have other symptoms of pregnancy, you might want to take a pregnancy test for peace of mind. If the test is negative and your period still doesn't come, you should consider seeing a healthcare provider to rule out other conditions that can cause changes in your menstrual cycle. It's important to remember to use a reliable method of birth control consistently in the future, and to consider getting checked for STDs if you're having unprotected sex. Your health is important.",
    "158": "Hi! Based on your description, it seems like you might be dealing with inflamed lymph nodes or possibly an infection of the hair follicles known as folliculitis, especially if there's soreness or tenderness around that area. These conditions often are not serious but can be uncomfortable. However, any new lump should be evaluated by a doctor – particularly if it doesn't go away after a week or two, or gets worse. Please do not hesitate to contact a healthcare professional who can examine you and provide you with a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. Thank you.",
    "159": "Hello, thank you for seeking medical advice. The symptoms you're describing could potentially indicate a fungal infection, which is quite common in warm, humid conditions or when personal hygiene is difficult to maintain. \n\nA fungal infection, often referred to as \"jock itch,\" can cause a rash and itchiness around your genital area, including the creases of your legs and scrotum. This rash is typically red, itchy and may appear as a patchy, scaly ring.\n\nYour throat soreness, neck and jaw pain could possibly be due to unrelated factors such as a viral or bacterial throat infection, or these could be symptoms of a generalised immune system response.\n\nFor the rash, you may benefit from an over-the-counter anti-fungal cream. Keep the area dry as much as possible, and consider using a medicated powder after showering. \n\nFor your throat symptoms, try warm salt water gargles, drink plenty of fluids and take over-the-counter pain relief if needed. \n\nBoth of these issues would ideally be evaluated in person by a healthcare provider. Please seek medical attention for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Until then, try to keep the area as clean and dry as possible and stay hydrated.\n\nRemember this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information.",
    "160": "Hello, I understand you're feeling a bit anxious after your embryo transfer. The symptoms you're expressing could be due to a variety of factors. It could be due to anxiety and stress which is quite common after such procedures. You could also be reacting to the fertility medications that you've taken. The bloating and gas are normal, due to the medications that you were put on as part of the procedure. \n\nIt's important to maintain a healthy diet and stay well hydrated. That might help with your gastrointestinal symptoms. \n\nHowever, the shortness of breath and rapid heart rate should not be ignored. Although it can be due to nervousness or anxiety, it could also be a sign of more serious problems like a blood clot. I would recommend you to reach out to your healthcare provider as soon as possible to discuss these symptoms. \n\nRemember that each person’s IVF experience can be completely unique, and symptoms can vary a lot. Try not to worry, and reach out to your doctor with any concerns.",
    "161": "Yes, I would recommend seeking medical attention. The feeling of irregular heart rhythms or \"fluttering\" in the chest, especially combined with a sensation of tightness and a family history of heart conditions, could be indicative of arrhythmias or other heart conditions. Though a heart rate up to 100 or so can be normal with exercise, the association with these other symptoms warrants examination. It's good that you've observed these symptoms; I encourage you to share these details with your doctor. They can perform further tests, such as an EKG or echocardiogram, to better understand your heart's function. For now, try to avoid strenuous activity until you can see your healthcare provider.",
    "162": "I'm sorry to hear about your persistent breathing problem. It seems like you could be dealing with a chronic respiratory condition such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Unicontin contains theophylline, a bronchodilator used to treat these kind of conditions. You mentioned your symptoms seem to be getting worse despite ongoing treatment, which is concerning. You should get in touch with a pulmonologist or your primary care doctor as soon as possible. They may recommend a spirometry test or a chest X-Ray to check up on your lungs.\n\nIn addition, make sure you're following lifestyle advice to manage your symptoms: avoiding asthma triggers, not smoking, staying active, and eating a balanced diet. Also, it's important to take your medication as prescribed and use a 'rescue' inhaler if you have one. This is general advice and should all be used in conjunction with a discussion with your doctor.",
    "163": "Hello,\n\nMenstrual cycles can be irregular for a variety of reasons, including stress, significant changes in weight, or illness. However, a pregnancy can't be ruled out completely even if your boyfriend did not ejaculate inside of you, as there can be a small chance of pregnancy due to the pre-ejaculate fluid.\n\nThe dark brown discharge you observed could be from old blood that was left from your last menstrual cycle or even your body adjusting from discontinuing birth control. Occasionally, some women might experience mid-cycle or ovulation spotting, which may appear brown and sometimes can be accompanied by mild cramping.\n\nIt's also possible you might have experienced what's called implantation bleeding, which can happen when a fertilized egg attaches to the lining of your uterus, although it's usually lighter and shorter than a regular period.\n\nGiven the change in your cycle and that your period is a week late, I would suggest taking a home pregnancy test for clarification. If the test is negative and you continue to experience irregular periods or the brown discharge, please follow up with a healthcare provider. A detailed medical examination probably will help in getting to the root cause. Moreover, if you're trying to conceive, it will be beneficial to have regular check-ups with your healthcare provider.\n\nTake care and stay healthy.",
    "164": "I'm sorry to hear you're having such a tough time. The symptoms you describe - swollen feet and ankles, headaches, and dizziness - can be common in pregnancy but they can also be signs of a condition called preeclampsia. Preeclampsia can be serious if not properly monitored and treated, so it's important to get medical attention. You should contact your healthcare provider right away or, if that's not possible, going to the hospital is a reasonable step. They will probably check your blood pressure, test your urine for protein, and maybe do some blood tests. Please seek medical attention immediately.",
    "165": "Yes, the IUD could be contributing to your pelvic pain. In some women, an IUD can cause pain and discomfort, especially during your period. That being said, it's important to ensure nothing else is causing this pain, such as an ovarian cyst or infection, so do discuss it with your healthcare provider if the pain persists or gets worse.\n\nAs for the medication, Zerodol (aceclofenac) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain. However, it's crucial not to exceed the recommended dosage without consulting with your doctor. If Zerodol isn't providing the relief you need, contact your healthcare provider about adjusting your medication plan or exploring other pain management options. Do not increase your dose without guidance from your physician.",
    "166": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your injury. While I understand your concern about aesthetics, the priority should be to ensure the health and function of your mouth. The most immediate solution for your situation could be a temporary denture or a dental bridge, which can be placed in a short period of time, usually within a week. This device will allow you to have a normal-looking smile while you undergo the necessary procedures for your dental implants. Please consult with your dentist or an oral and maxillofacial surgeon to explore these options. Always remember, any injury to the face can have other implications and must be thoroughly examined to rule out any other issues.",
    "167": "I'm sorry to hear about your accident. The pain in your buttocks and rear of your legs might not be directly related to the concussion and brain bleed. It could be due to a pinched nerve, known as sciatica, that can be caused by the pressure on the lumbar or sacral nerves. This condition often leads to pain in the lower back and legs. Sometimes, the stress or trauma of a fall could exacerbate pre-existing conditions like this. However, to get a definitive diagnosis, it's best to consult with a neurologist or neurosurgeon. They may recommend imaging studies such as an MRI or CT scan to evaluate the lumbar spine and nerves. Always follow up with your doctors regarding new or chronic symptoms.",
    "168": "I'm sorry to hear about your mother's health issues. Chronic lung congestion in heart patients is often due to heart failure. In heart failure, the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should. When the heart's pumping becomes less efficient, fluid can build up, leading to symptoms of congestion. This includes shortness of breath, swollen legs, and fatigue.\n\nHeart failure is especially common in patients who have had a heart attack or who also have other conditions like diabetes, both of which apply to your mother. Since she has stents in her arteries and is experiencing lung congestion, it could likely be due to heart failure.\n\nShe needs to be evaluated by a cardiologist for the management of heart failure. Medications and lifestyle changes can often control heart failure. Medications might include ACE inhibitors or beta blockers to improve heart function, as well as diuretics to reduce fluid accumulation. Lifestyle changes might include a reduced-salt diet, regular physical activity as recommended by a doctor, and close monitoring of daily fluid intake.\n\nEmergency care is important when symptoms worsen rapidly. If breathing difficulties increase suddenly or if she has other urgent symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nAlso, regular follow-up care is essential to adjust treatments as necessary and to monitor conditions. Please consult with your mother's doctor or a specialist in heart failure for detail evaluation and management.\n",
    "169": "Hello. It`s Dr. [Your Name] here. The symptoms you described may be due to a condition called balanitis, which is inflammation of the skin covering the head (glans) of the penis. It can occur in uncircumcised men due to various causes like bacterial or fungal infections, irritation, or other skin conditions. Along with the skin changes, inability to retract the foreskin (phimosis) can also occur due to inflammation or recurrent infections. \n\nI would recommend you see a healthcare provider for an evaluation as soon as possible. They may take a sample (swab test) from your penis to identify the cause of your symptoms and prescribe the appropriate treatment, which can include creams for the skin changes or medications for an infection. It's important to clean under your foreskin daily with warm water. Also, remember to pull your foreskin back over the head of your penis after cleaning. In some cases, when foreskin retraction problems persist after other treatments, a procedure or surgery like circumcision may be recommended.\n\nPlease know that seeking medical attention for this is absolutely necessary and there is no need to be embarrassed. Doctors are there to help you.",
    "170": "Hello. Your symptoms suggest two possibilities. First, there may be an issue with the root canal treated tooth itself, such as a reinfection. Second, there can be a problem with the crown like improper fitting or a leakage. This might have led to food lodgment and subsequently gum inflammation around that tooth. Either way, it's advisable to see a dentist as soon as possible for an examination and an X-ray, to ensure a detailed evaluation and correct diagnosis. It's important to address these issues promptly to prevent further complications. Until your dental appointment, maintain good oral hygiene. Please do not delay your visit to the dentist.",
    "171": "Conception depends on a variety of factors, including ovulation, sperm health, and any underlying conditions in both partners. \n\nIt's normal to try for up to a year before getting pregnant, especially when you're under 35 and are having regular, unprotected sex. You may want to try tracking her ovulation. This typically occurs 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period, but it can vary. Using an ovulation prediction kit may help. \n\nHaving sex every 2-3 days throughout your wife's menstrual cycle will likely increase your chances of success. \n\nAs for diet, a balanced diet is key. This should include plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and healthy fats. Adequate intake of folate or folic acid, which is found in green leafy vegetables, beans, and fortified cereals, is also particularly important for the early stages of pregnancy.\n\nIf you continue to have difficulty, I recommend you both consult with a healthcare provider or fertility specialist to ensure there are no underlying health issues.",
    "172": "Hello, I understand your concerns. Given your symptoms of neck pain, fever, night sweats, increased heart rate, low hemoglobin, weight loss, and a thyroid scan that reported an infection in the thyroid, it sounds like you might have thyroiditis. Thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid gland, it can cause pain and discomfort in the neck area, fever, and can affect your metabolism, causing increased heart rate and weight loss. Moreover, if you have an infection, this could be contributing to your symptoms as well. Anemia, from either decreased production of red blood cells or increased destruction, can lead to low hemoglobin levels, which can also be associated with weight loss and can cause an increase in heart rate. I would recommend you to follow up with your doctor, as you might need antibiotics if this is a bacterial infection and further tests to find out the cause of your anemia. Please let me know if you have any other questions.",
    "173": "Thanks for trusting me to answer your question. Chronic alcohol drinking can lead to fatty liver disease, hepatitis, and ultimately cirrhosis or liver failure. It seems likely that your alcohol use has caused some damage to your liver, especially as indicated by the high ALT and AST values.\n\nWhile a certain degree of liver regeneration is possible when the injurious agent (alcohol in your case) is removed, the extent to which this happens would depend on the amount of existing liver damage. Sometimes, even after abstaining from alcohol, there can be progression of liver disease.\n\nRemember, other factors like viral hepatitis, auto-immune conditions, certain medications and metabolic conditions like Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease could also contribute to liver injury. Therefore, I would recommend that you not only reduce your alcohol consumption but also go in for a complete evaluation to rule out these conditions.\n\nYou might need an ultrasound of the liver and maybe even a biopsy to confirm the cause and extent of liver damage. Please see a gastroenterologist or a hepatologist as soon as you can to discuss this further. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions.",
    "174": "Hello. From what I understand, the bite has turned into a minor infection, as indicated by the pus. \n\nKeeping the area clean is important, along with applying a topical antibiotic ointment (like Neosporin or similar) after washing with mild soap and water. The bandage is also a good idea, as it helps protect the wound. \n\nIn addition, you can help reduce inflammation and discomfort by applying a cold pack to the area for 10-15 minutes at a time (with a cloth between the cold pack and your skin to prevent direct contact which can lead to skin damage).\n\nIf you notice any worsening signs such as increasing pain, swelling, redness, or drainage, or if you develop a fever, I would recommend seeking medical care promptly.\n\nRemember that while the antibiotics you are carrying might be helpful in treating a severe infection, it's important not to self-treat without guidance from a healthcare provider. Improper use of antibiotics can lead to damage, including promoting antibiotic resistance.\n\nI hope this helps and wish you a quick healing.",
    "175": "Hi, I understand your concern. It appears your mother may have had an episode of spinal cord stroke or a lesion there presenting as a clot. Now, a hematologist's consultation might be suggested to evaluate the blood components and clotting parameters - to understand if there's an underlying disorder that caused this clot and to prevent the risk of future incidents. \n\nAdditionally, the right treatment methodology highly depends on the location and size of the clot, the damage it might have caused, general health of the patient, and other individual factors. The course of treatment can range from medication management to surgical interventions in certain cases. \n\nI would recommend following the advice of your current physicians and consulting with the hematologist as they have the complete understanding of the patient's condition. A Hematologist would give you a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and suggest the next course of action. However, if you are uncertain, there is no harm in seeking a second opinion from a neurologist or a neurosurgeon.",
    "176": "Hello, your body shaking during a stressful situation like an argument is a normal body response to stress or anxiety. You can call it a minor form of 'Fight or flight' reaction. It's important to develop good stress management techniques or try grounding exercises to keep yourself calm in such situations.\n\nAbout fainting during your period, it might be a combination of severe dysmenorrhea (painful periods) and your diet. When you diet extensively and don't get enough nutrition, it can make your body weak and cause dizziness or fainting, especially if you have severe period pain. Try to follow a balanced diet, maintain a healthy weight for your height, and stay hydrated. If your period pain is very severe, it would be good to get it checked by a doctor as sometimes it can be a symptom of conditions like endometriosis. Also consider checking your hemoglobin levels, as anemia can also lead to lightheadedness. \n\nRemember to have a healthy lifestyle and always consult your physician when you embark on a new diet or exercise regimen.",
    "177": "Hello, your ultrasound results suggest that you have cysts in your liver, which are usually harmless, fluid-filled areas. The extrarenal pelvis and your gallbladder being prominent can be normal variations. It's important to know whether these cysts are causing your symptoms, or if they're discrete entities. It's not uncommon for certain liver cysts, even large ones, to not cause any symptoms. \nThe dilation of your common bile duct and pancreatic duct being at the upper limits of normal could be due to the multiple stones in your kidney. These stones can sometimes cause an obstruction, leading to dilation of these ducts. Kidney stones can be very painful and might be causing your symptoms. Treatment of kidney stones can be conservative with increased water intake and pain relief, but in some cases, intervention may be needed to remove or break up the stones.\nIt's very important that you consult your physician or a specialist in gastroenterology to discuss these findings in more detail and to plan for further evaluations and treatment. The findings on this report need clinical correlation. Pain management would be an immediate priority.",
    "178": "I'm sorry to hear about your discomfort. You are doing the right thing by seeking physical therapy, acupuncture, and performing stretches. Pain management for piriformis syndrome often includes NSAIDs, like your Celebrex prescription. Your Tylenol 3 contains codeine, which can help with more severe pain.\n\nIn addition to what you're already taking, muscle relaxants such as tizanidine, or baclofen, may provide some relief from your symptoms. Also, some people with nerve pain find relief from drugs that were originally developed for seizures, such as gabapentin or pregabalin.\n\nMore invasive options, such as steroid injections or even Botox injections can be considered. These should be administered by a specialist. However, most cases of piriformis syndrome can be managed well with conservative treatment - medications, physical therapy, stretches, and activity modification.\n\nLastly, remember that it's important to consult your personal healthcare provider before starting or changing any medications. They know your medical history and can provide personalized advice.",

The Indian Cancer Society, Cancer Aid & Research Foundation (CARF), and Cancer Patients Aid Association (CPAA) are just a few of these. If your uncle is eligible, these organizations may be able to help with some of his medical expenses or attain care. Additionally, there may be specific programs or aid available in Kerala. I would recommend reaching out to these organizations, as well as local government offices or healthcare providers, to ask about potential resources. It's also crucial that your uncle receives appropriate medical care, including pain management. Please consult with the doctors on this issue.",
    "180": "Hello! I understand your concern. The painful lump that you are experiencing might be linked to your menstrual cycle. Your body's lymphatic system can respond to hormonal changes before your period, which might cause the lump to grow, and it might not completely go away even after your period. We refer to these lumps as cyclical breast lumps—they are generally harmless, but they can cause discomfort. \n\nHowever, since you are experiencing persistent pain and the lump doesn't completely go away, it would be wise to follow your GP's advice and return when it's at its worst. This will provide your doctor a good opportunity to evaluate the lump under different circumstances. Until then, gentle massage, a warm or cold compress, and over-the-counter pain relievers might help to alleviate the discomfort. \n\nRemember that while most lumps are benign, it's crucial to keep an eye on any changes and report them promptly to your healthcare provider. Regular self-breast examinations between menstrual cycles can also be a helpful habit to maintain.",

    "182": "Hello, this is a perfectly valid question, so there's no need to apologize! Whether you choose to remove pubic hair is completely up to you and depends on your personal preference. There's no right or wrong choice, and it's important that whatever you choose, you're doing it because you want to, not because you feel like you have to. Some people choose to leave their pubic hair natural, others trim it, and some remove it completely through shaving, waxing or other methods. Keep in mind, these different methods can have different side effects, like ingrown hairs or skin irritation. Always go to a professional for services such as waxing, as doing it improperly could result in complications. If you decide to shave, make sure to use a fresh, clean razor and shave in the direction of hair growth to avoid razor burn. When in doubt, consult with a trusted adult or healthcare provider. And remember, every body is different and unique, and your decision should be based on what makes you feel comfortable and confident.\n",

    "184": "Hello, Thank you for the question. In children jaundice or hyperbilirubinemia can be either from liver diseases, an increase in the production of bilirubin or decreased removal of bilirubin. The treatment and duration of jaundice will depend on the cause of the jaundice. The child would need a complete history and physical examination.\n\nFor liver enzyme tests, it would mean that one must also measure the amounts of AST and ALT along with bilirubin. It can be due to various liver diseases like hepatitis, or other metabolic diseases. Management depends on the cause.\n\nThere are some conditions like gallstones and biliary atresia which can lead to obstructive jaundice, which are treated by the surgical and GI team respectively. \n\nRegarding diet, there's no specific diet for jaundice. However, maintaining good hydration is important. Encourage him to drink lots of fluids like water, unsweetened fruit juices. Try to give him a balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, cereals, whole grains, lean meat and fish so that his immunity stays strong. Avoid fried or fatty foods.\n\nPlease consult with your child's pediatrician who can guide you better after assessing his health status.",
    "185": "I'm sorry to hear your son is not feeling well. It's not uncommon for a cough to linger for several weeks following a lung infection like pneumonia. This happens because the bronchial tubes in the lungs are inflamed and need time to heal. Coughing up white or clear mucus is also normal during the recovery period.\n\nHowever, it is essential to monitor his symptoms closely. If he develops a fever, starts feeling generally unwell again, or the cough significantly worsens, these could be signs of a secondary bacterial infection or that the pneumonia has returned, and you should seek medical attention immediately.\n\nFor now, ensure he is drinking plenty of fluids, resting, and eating a balanced diet to support his immune system. If the cough is particularly bothersome, a cough suppressant might be beneficial, but consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication.\n\nPlease do get in touch with your doctor if you have more concerns or your son's symptoms continue to persist or worsen. Low-level activity such as gentle walks can also be beneficial to help the lungs to recover. Everyone's recovery time is different, so please don't worry if your son’s symptoms don't disappear immediately - but do keep an eye out for any worsening symptoms.",
    "186": "Hi Jamini, thank you for your question. FNAC, or Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology, is a well-established technique used by doctors to take a sample from a lump or tumor for further analysis in the laboratory. It is a very safe procedure, and the risk of spreading a cancerous tumor via this procedure is extremely low. This method allows doctors to make an initial diagnosis and plan the most effective treatment for the patient before resorting to surgery. It's important to understand that not all tumors are cancerous, and the FNAC test can help determine whether a tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). It would be wise to follow the advice of your surgeon and proceed with the FNAC test. I wish the very best to your mother.\n",

The findings on the sonography indicate a few things:\n\n1) \"Moderate hepatomegaly with grade 1 fatty infiltration\": This means that the liver is somewhat larger than normal and there is a mild level of fat accumulation in the liver. This could be due to many reasons including obesity, alcohol consumption, certain medications, etc. It would be important to try and figure out the cause so that specific treatment can be given.\n\n2) \"Mild gallbladder wall thickening\": This suggests some inflammation of the gallbladder, possibly due to gallstones. Further investigations, like a CT scan or an MRCP, might be needed to confirm this.\n\n3) \"Mild splenomegaly\": This indicates that the spleen is mildly enlarged. There are many reasons for this, including liver disease, blood disorders, or infection.\n\n4) \"Grade 1 medical renal disease\": This is a mild degree of kidney disease.

    "188": "Hello, Mercy. The symptoms you describe may indicate acid reflux or gastritis, conditions in which stomach acid is pushed up into the esophagus and can cause burning sensations. The pain in your lower abdomen could possibly be related to your digestive system as well, particularly if you're experiencing other symptoms like changes in bowel movement, bloating, or gas. \n\nConsidering your symptoms, I would suggest:\n1. Avoid late-night meals or large meals.\n2. Limit foods that can trigger acid reflux, such as spicy foods, alcohol, caffeine, and fatty foods.\n3. Try to elevate your head while sleeping.\n4. Stay hydrated, but avoid drinking large quantities of water in a short time period.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to see a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. If these symptoms persist or worsen over time, please seek medical attention as these could be symptoms of a more serious condition, like an ulcer or gallbladder disease. You may need investigations like an endoscopy or ultrasound to determine the exact cause of your symptoms.",
    "189": "Hello,\n\nThe white discharge you noticed might be the cervical mucus which often changes around ovulation, becoming more abundant and stretchy, similar to the consistency of egg whites. This is a sign that you're in your fertile phase.\n\nYou were correct to have sexual intercourse during this time, as it is generally the optimal time for conception. It's important to understand, though, that even with perfect timing, not every cycle will result in a pregnancy.\n\nWhile Letrozole can stimulate ovulation and improve fertility, it does not guarantee pregnancy. Keep in mind that even healthy couples with no fertility issues only have about a 20% chance of getting pregnant each cycle. \n\nConsidering everything, there's certainly a chance you could be pregnant this cycle. However, only a positive pregnancy test can confirm this. You can take an at-home pregnancy test the day after your missed period. If it’s negative and your period hasn’t started, wait a few more days and test again.\n\nIf after trying to conceive for a year, you're still not pregnant, please consult a fertility specialist with your husband for further evaluation. Best wishes.\n",
    "190": "What you're describing sounds like it could be related to over-exertion or fatigue, causing strain on her back muscles, which can trigger discomfort or pain. Her prior surgery could make her more susceptible to feeling pain or discomfort in response to strenuous work. Sometimes, body-shivers or shivering can happen in response to severe pain. For the swelling in the collarbones, that's not typically related to a disc problem in the lower spine, and may need to be evaluated separately. I would advise her to take it easy and avoid strenuous or heavy lifting activities as much as possible to avoid putting undue stress on her back. She should continue to strengthen her back with appropriate physiotherapy exercises. And importantly, she should check in with her doctor to further investigate these symptoms, especially the collarbone swelling.\n",

    "192": "Hello, I understand your concern. It seems you've been dealing with a persistent urinary tract infection (UTI) that hasn't resolved with multiple courses of different antibiotics. The presence of pus cells in urine indicates an ongoing infection, yet the culture is sterile which means the organism causing the infection is not been identified. \n\nGiven the persistent symptoms and the history of pyeloplasty, it's important to ensure you do not have a structural abnormality or obstruction that's predisposing you to these recurrent infections. A CECT Urography could definitely provide more information on the anatomical status of your urinary tract. \n\nThe prescription of tuberculosis medicine seems to be considering a possible diagnosis of genitourinary tuberculosis, which can sometimes present this way with a 'sterile' UTI and persistent symptoms.\n\nThe bone scan could be proposed with the aim of ruling out any abnormalities in the bone that may be contributing to your symptoms. \n\nFollow your doctor's directions for the tests and continue your prescribed medications unless directed otherwise by your doctor. It's important to maintain open communication with your healthcare team, discuss your concerns and understand the reasoning behind their recommendations. \n\nPlease remember that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation.

Based on the details you've shared about your health situation, it's clear that you've been through a lot and are very mindful of your health. However, as far as caffeine in relation to your intestinal issues, there isn't significant data to suggest that moderate coffee intake could lead to 'leaky gut' or other concerning intestinal conditions, particularly if you're otherwise healthy and not predisposed to these conditions. The main concerns with coffee are mostly related to its potential to stimulate the gastrointestinal tract, causing increased bowel activity and promoting gastroesophageal reflux. Controversy also exists about whether or not it might contribute to certain conditions like heartburn or IBS, which does not seem to be your situation.\nAs long as your coffee consumption doesn't seem to cause discomfort or distress, it's likely okay to continue enjoying it in moderation. Be sure to monitor your body's responses and consult with your health professional if you notice any changes. I recommend keeping open communication with your chiropractic physician and discuss your love for coffee and the benefits it brings you along with his concerns for your health.\nRemember, it's always important to maintain a balanced and diverse diet, and to stay well-hydrated - which it sounds like you're doing.

These shoes are specifically designed to reduce the risk of skin breakdown in diabetics with pre-existing foot disease. \n\nHowever, I strongly recommend discussing this with your father's doctor or a podiatrist before making any decisions. The right choice can greatly depend on the exact nature and severity of your father's foot condition. As for where to get such shoes, they're often available at specialty shoe stores or can be ordered online. Make sure to get them properly fitted, as an improper fit can lead to more problems.\n\nRemember, though, that therapeutic footwear only helps manage and prevent the condition.

    "198": "Tramadol is a unique prescription pain medicine similar to opioids. However, it's classified as a \"centrally acting opioid analgesic,\" which means it targets the central nervous system and changes the way your brain perceives pain.

However, drug tests vary and some can be more sensitive, so it's not 100% guaranteed that Tramadol won't result in a positive test. \n\nRegarding your back pain, while Tramadol may provide some relief, it is not a long-term solution. If you have not already, please consider seeking a referral to a specialist such as a physical therapist, chiropractor or pain specialist who can help you with your back pain. Other non-medication methods such as physical therapy, low-impact exercises, heating pad or ice pack application, and maintaining a healthy weight might also help alleviate your back pain.

Based on risk factors including your known heart disease, cigarette smoking, and some issues about weight and stress, the American Heart Association has developed a series of calculators which might give you some sense of your health trajectory over the next 10 years. However, the good news is that you've already taken some good steps by losing weight and managing your condition with appropriate medications. \n\nI would encourage you to follow up with your cardiac doctor about this, as more detailed predictions on personal life spans are hard to identify and tend to be non-specific.

Your situation is unique and the sooner you take steps to address your risk factors, the better your prognosis will be. \n\nPlease do follow up with your primary care provider or cardiologist who can provide a more nuanced understanding of your risk based on more information.

PS/ED Velocity stands for Peak Systolic/End Diastolic Velocity. It's a measure of blood flow speed in the carotid arteries. The systolic number is the velocity when your heart beats (pumps blood), and the diastolic number is the velocity when your heart is at rest (between beats). Both measures are important as increased levels may indicate narrowed or blocked arteries.\n\n2. CCA, ICA and ECA refer to different parts of the carotid arteries. Specifically, CCA is the Common Carotid Artery, ICA is the Internal Carotid Artery, and ECA is the External Carotid Artery. The numbers are the PS/ED Velocity measurements at these places.\n\n3. ICA/CCA 1.29 - This is a ratio calculated by dividing the Peak Systolic Velocity of the Internal Carotid Artery by that of the Common Carotid Artery.

They may adjust the treatment plan, which may include an extended course of antibiotics or different medication.\n\nThe decision to continue with the root canal treatment or to opt for extraction generally depends on the severity of the infection, the prognosis of the tooth, and your dentist's expert judgment. It's always preferable to save the natural tooth if possible, but in some cases where the infection persists or the structure of the tooth is severely compromised, extraction may be the best option.\n\nI recommend discussing your symptoms and concerns with your dentist to help decide the best course of action. They will guide you based on the responses of your specific case to the treatment so far. Please remember, maintaining constant communication with your dentist is crucial during this process.",
    "211": "Hello, \n\nBased on what you described, there might be two different conditions affecting you - kidney stones and varicocele. The stones in the kidney could indeed cause a pain as you described, but it's also important to note that 5mm and 6mm stones could still potentially pass through the urine. Your doctor has prescribed medications accordingly.\n\nFor the varicocele, this is a condition that can affect fertility if severe. However, mild varicoceles often don't require immediate surgery unless it's causing significant discomfort or issues such as infertility.\n\nConsidering the descriptions from both doctors, it's advisable to consult a urologist and discuss both issues at the same time. They can provide a holistic plan considering your overall health status and potential implications. Ultimately, the decision to proceed with surgery should be made after considering the potential benefits and risks.",
    "212": "Hello, thanks for reaching out. It's perfectly normal to have some apprehension when facing surgery for the first time. Laparoscopy is generally a safe and straightforward procedure, often performed to diagnose and treat conditions affecting the reproductive organs, among other things.\n\nWithout knowing the specific reason your doctor is recommending laparoscopy, it's difficult to say whether you can get pregnant without it. For some matters, like certain types of fertility issues, a laparoscopy might be necessary to identify and treat the underlying problem. However, given your favourable medical report, if you're unsure or anxious about the surgery, you can always seek a second opinion or discuss your concerns further with your doctor.\n\nDo keep in mind that laparoscopy is a common and standard procedure, generally with low associated risks, and could help in identifying any potential impediment to natural conception.\n\nRemember, you should always feel comfortable and confident in the medical decisions being made. Open communication with your healthcare provider is essential in ensuring you get the care you need.",
    "213": "Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor. From your description, it seems those could be tonsil stones, or tonsilloliths, which are clumps of bacteria, mucus, and other substances that have calcified and become lodged in your tonsils. However, as those should typically be changed with antibiotics, I would recommend you to see an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist for a detailed examination. It can also be benign growths, infections, or less likely, cancerous lumps. Proper examination and if needed, biopsy, would be able to clearly diagnose the issue. Hope this helps.",
    "214": "Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing this discomfort. The symptoms you describe - pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness - could potentially indicate some form of nerve compression, perhaps due to an injury or inflammation. This could occur at any point along the nerve, from where it originates in your neck to where it ends in your hand, and could be proceeded by many causes. However, it's also important to remember that overuse or strain (such as from writing for long periods) could cause similar symptoms. It's impossible to diagnose you over the internet, so it's crucial that you see a healthcare provider in person as soon as you can. Please tell your parents, school nurse, or another responsible adult about your symptoms so they can assess the next steps and help you make an appointment with a healthcare provider.",
    "215": "Based on your description, it's possible that you could have a condition known as arrhythmia. This is when the heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or irregularly. An extreme low heart rate is referred to as bradycardia, while a very fast heart rate is known as tachycardia. Dizziness, shortness of breath, weakness, chest pain, and fatigue are among the symptoms. \n\nBear in mind, however, that this is only one possibility. Other heart conditions or even anxiety or panic attacks might induce similar symptoms. A thorough consultation with a cardiologist, possibly including additional evaluations such as an echocardiogram or stress test, is recommended for a precise diagnosis. \n\nContact your doctor or go to the emergency room if your chest pain is severe or comes with other symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting. Please note that this advice is intended to help you understand what could be causing your symptoms but should not replace a consultation with a medical professional.",
    "216": "Hello, I'm really sorry to hear about all the different symptoms you're experiencing. Based on what you're describing it seems like you have multiple gastrointestinal issues going on, including constipation, gas, dehydration, weight loss, and potentially colitis and acid reflux.\n\nI recommend you to a gastrointestinal specialist (a gastroenterologist). They can further investigate potential causes of your symptoms with tests like a colonoscopy and endoscopy. It's also important you stay hydrated, especially if you have darker urine and feelings of dehydration. It's also important to have a balanced diet rich in fiber.  \n\nAs for the chest pain, this could be related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This is a condition in which stomach acid frequently flows back into your esophagus (the tube connecting your mouth and stomach), causing irritation. Please consult with the gastroenterologist about this too.\n\nFinally, regarding your smoking, it would also be beneficial to try and stop, as smoking can contribute to a multitude of health issues including those you're currently experiencing. If you're ready and willing to quit, there are many treatments that can increase your chances of success. \n\nDespite your bad experience with a previous doctor, please don't hesitate to seek further medical advice. These symptoms are significantly affecting your quality of life and, in the case of weight loss and constant weakness, could be signs of a serious underlying condition. Your health is worth fighting for. \n\nI hope you find relief very soon.",

Generally, after a head injury, severe and continuous headaches, fever, vomiting, lethargy, and increasing confusion are warning signs that there might be serious aftereffects like a concussion or even a slow bleed in her brain. Even though these symptoms are occurring a week after the fall, they should not be ignored. I advise you to seek immediate medical attention. Take her to the emergency room or a healthcare provider as soon as possible.",
    "218": "I'm sorry to hear about your brother's discomfort. It's possible that the swelling on his nose could be related to some sort of chronic infection or even an inflammatory response to the remaining titanium from the dental implant in his gum. I would recommend he consults with an oral surgeon to assess if the remaining titanium could be contributing to his symptoms. If that's not the cause, a dermatologist could potentially provide insight as it may be a skin condition causing the weeping wound and swelling. If the endocrinologist has ruled out hormonal imbalances and the neurologist didn't find any neurological causes, these would be the best next steps in my opinion. If antibiotics aren't clearing up the issue, there might be an underlying cause that's yet to be discovered. Also, ensure he continues to follow up with his GP. It's important that all his doctors are conversing and have access to his full medical history.\n",
    "220": "Hello, I understand your concern. High FSH levels and azoospermia can be a challenging combination when trying to conceive. Azoospermia means there is no sperm in the semen. This could be due to a blockage (obstructive azoospermia) or due to a problem with sperm production (non-obstructive azoospermia). In some cases, surgical sperm retrieval might be an option, particularly if the problem is due to a blockage. However, if sperm production is the issue, this can be more difficult to treat. \n\nIn terms of high FSH levels, this hormone is critical for sperm production, and high levels could indicate a problem with the testes or hypothalamus or pituitary gland. However, it's important to remember that hormone levels are only one piece of the puzzle and their precise role in infertility is not completely understood. \n\nThe best course of action would be to work closely with a fertility specialist. There are several treatment options which may be beneficial depending on the precise cause of the issue. These could include lifestyle changes, medication to balance hormone levels or surgical procedures. In some cases, your fertility specialist may recommend using donor sperm.\n\nRemember that it's important to explore all of your options and ask questions so that you can make the best decision for you and your partner.",
    "221": "Hi, the mini pill (progestin-only pill) needs to be taken consistently within the same three-hour window each day to be effective. It offers a 27-hour window to provide continuous pregnancy protection. Since you missed a pill and did not take it within the next 27 hours, there is a slight risk of ovulation and thus a slight risk of pregnancy. The effectiveness of the pill is estimated to be around 91% with \"typical use\", mainly due to inconsistent or incorrect use. \n\nYou should take your missed pill as soon as you remember and continue with your normal schedule, even if this means taking two pills in one day. As a precaution, you should also use additional contraception, such as condoms, for the next two days.\n\nIf you had unprotected sex during this time (as you mentioned), there is a risk of pregnancy. If you're especially concerned, you may consider emergency contraception within 72 hours of unprotected sex, but consult a healthcare provider for your best options. Pregnancy tests will be most accurate if you wait until the time when your period would normally be due.\n\nRemember, this advice is general in nature, and your exact risks may vary based on your specific medical history and situation. For personalized advice, please consult a healthcare provider.",

It's hard to provide exact advice without knowing the full extent of your situation, however I can give you some general pointers.\n\nYou've mentioned that you've tried multiple therapies—which is good—it means you're proactive about managing your condition. However, non-operative treatment options can take time and require a high level of compliance for best results. \n\nContinue a regimen of physical therapy focusing on core strengthening and stabilization exercises, as well as pain management techniques. You might also want to consider cognitive-behavioral therapy since chronic pain can often lead to feelings of depression, and understanding how your mind can affect pain can be beneficial.\n\nAs for medications, it's typically a balance between managing pain relief and side effects. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), nerve pain medications such as gabapentin and muscle relaxants are common non-opioid options. Opioids can sometimes be used but with extreme caution given the risk for dependency. There's also the option of the pain relief patches, gels or creams that you can directly apply to the painful area.\n\nCommunication with your doctor is key. Make sure to express your goals, expectations and fears regarding your condition and the impending surgery. Ask them any questions you might have about the procedure, recovery and potential risks involved. \n\nIt's also a good idea to seek second or third opinions before deciding on surgery, especially if you're young and the decision about surgery is not",
    "223": "Hello, good day to you. I understand your concern. Although black dots under the nails can be an indicator of diabetes or melanoma (a type of skin cancer), most often they are harmless and caused by a simple injury to the nail. However, with any change in skin or nail color, it's always a good idea to have it checked out by a healthcare provider to rule out serious conditions. Considering your age and health, I wouldn't immediately jump to necrosis or poor circulation as a cause. The fact that it hasn't grown in size and doesn't cause any pain or swelling, is generally a good sign. But do set up an appointment with a dermatologist or your primary care physician to get it evaluated properly. Don't worry too much, as chances are it's nothing serious. Please see your doctor as soon as possible for peace of mind and to rule out any possible issues.",
    "224": "I'm sorry to hear about your discomfort. From your symptoms, it seems like you may have developed a canker sore (or aphthous ulcer) on your tongue because of the constant irritation from the sharp edge of the broken tooth. This should heal in one to two weeks.\n\nFor the pain and difficulty swallowing, it might be due to an infection or inflammation in your throat. It could be related to the dental procedure or may be a separate issue.\n\nTo keep you comfortable until the sore heals, you can rinse your mouth with warm salt water and use over-the-counter oral anesthetic gels for relief of pain. If the problem persists, it'll best to consult with an ENT specialist.\n\nAs for the white structure in your throat, it's hard to say without a physical examination. It could potentially be a tonsil stone, an infection, or even an ulcer similar to the one on your tongue. A healthcare provider should look at it to make accurate diagnosis and necessary treatment. \n\nRemember not to skip your post-operative sessions with the dentist who performed the root canal, as they will help ensure proper healing and spot any potential problems. \nPlease note that these are general advises, always consult with your local healthcare provider before starting any treatment. I hope this helps you and wish you a quick recovery.",
    "225": "The symptoms you're experiencing, including coughing up green phlegm and slightly increased eosinophils, could be signs of a bacterial respiratory infection. The increase in vascular bronchi lines on your X-ray could also be a result of this infection or inflammation. \n\nIf your symptoms have returned after finishing your prescribed medication, this could mean that the bacterial infection wasn't entirely cleared, or that you are re-infected. It could also potentially point to a chronic condition such as bronchitis or COPD, depending on additional symptoms and your overall health.\n\nIn any case, when symptoms return after treatment, it is important to get in touch with your doctor again for re-evaluation. You may need another course of antibiotics, or additional tests might be needed to get to the bottom of your recurring symptoms. In the meantime, try to rest, stay hydrated, avoid tobacco smoke, and eat healthful foods to support your immune system.",
    "226": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Bronchospasm is commonly associated with conditions such as asthma, bronchitis and COPD, especially among smokers. The duration of bronchospasm can vary person to person depending upon the severity of the condition, response to medication and measures taken to manage the condition.\n\nQuitting smoking will significantly help to improve your condition as it will reduce irritation and inflammation in your airways. The steroids and inhaler you've been prescribed should help to control your symptoms by reducing inflammation and relaxing the muscles in your airways. You should start feeling better within a week or two but if your symptoms persist or worsen, please consult with your doctor again for further management.\n\nIn the meantime you can also take other measures such as avoid exposure to allergens or irritants that may trigger bronchospasm, regular exercise and a balanced diet strongly support lung health. Also, it might be beneficial to learn and practice certain breathing exercises that can possibly help keep the airways open and ease your symptoms.\n\nBut please remember: All these are general lifestyle tips which usually help in respiratory conditions. Every patient is unique and you should always follow the advice of your treating healthcare provider. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

Symptoms: If you're experiencing constant discomfort, pain, or heaviness in the scrotum, surgery may be recommended to alleviate these symptoms.\n\n2. Infertility: Varicoceles are a common cause of decreased sperm quality and fertility issues in men. If you have lowered fertility correlated with varicocele, surgical management may improve your sperm quality and could potentially improve fertility.\n\n3. Testicular atrophy: Varicoceles can cause shrinkage of the testicles. If you have significant testicular atrophy, surgery may be recommended to prevent further atrophy and potential fertility issues.\n\nAs with any surgical procedure, the risks and benefits must be weighed, and the decision should be discussed thoroughly with a qualified urologist. Your past medical history, physical examination, and any necessary imaging or lab tests will also play a role in determining if surgery is right for you. Please consult your urologist or primary care physician to discuss these options and to make the best decision for your health.",

    "230": "Hello. Cherry Angiomas, also known as Campbell De Morgan spots, are common, harmless skin lesions that vary in number and size. They can occur anywhere on the body, although the trunk is the most common location. They are not typically associated with high levels of estrogen. Instead, they are believed to be associated with age, with most people developing them after the age of 30. In terms of treatment, no treatment is usually necessary unless they are irritating or you desire removal for cosmetic reasons.\n\nThat being said, it should be noted that too much estrogen can increase the risk of certain health conditions, such as breast cancer and uterine cancer. It can also increase the risk of blood clots, which given your history of multiple PEs, would be a concern. As you're already on warfarin, your risk would be managed but it's definitely something to discuss with your primary physician. They can order the appropriate hormonal assays and adjust your medication regimen or recommend lifestyle changes as needed.\n\nAlso, if the bright red spots are increasing in number or you notice any changes, please consult with a dermatologist just to be sure. While Cherry angiomas are harmless, it is always prudent to have any new or changing skin lesions checked.",

After the extraction of a tooth, it's normal for a clot to form to help the area heal, and it can sometimes feel like a 'scab' and it may appear as a dark red, jelly-like blot in the area where your tooth was removed. \n\nIf a 'dry socket' has developed (which is what happens when the clot is lost), it usually happens 2-4 days after the extraction. The symptoms include very severe pain, which often gets worse rather than better after the extraction. You might also notice a bad taste in your mouth or bad breath.\n\nHowever, as it's only been one day since your extraction, it's unlikely that a dry socket has developed this soon. Though, you still need to be careful. Do not spit forcefully or rinse for at least 24 hours after extraction. Avoid hot food or drinks until the numbing wears off. Do not consume alcohol for at least 24 hours. \n\nThe little swish wouldn't dislodge the clot, but again, be cautious not to do any vigorous rinses in the next 24 hours or so. If the pain intensity increases over the next few days or you notice an unpleasant smell or taste, it's a good idea to contact your dentist to have the area checked.\n\nIn the meantime, continue to maintain good oral hygiene, brush the rest of your teeth as you usually would, but avoid the area of the extraction.

Usually, if the lump is soft, movable, and not causing any pain or discomfort, it tends to be something non-serious like a lipoma (fatty tissue growth) or a lymph node that has enlarged due to a minor infection.\n\nHowever, to be sure, the pediatrician has wisely ordered a CT scan.

It could potentially be a muscle spasm caused by the intensity of the exercise, especially if you've just started running. \n\nIf you continue to experience these symptoms, I would recommend you to see a health care professional for further examination. You should also be careful not to push yourself too hard, especially in the beginning, take things slow and gradually build up your endurance. \n\nRemember, it's important to always warm up before and cool down after exercising.

Levels above 25 ng/mL can cause irregularities in ovulation which can pose difficulty in conceiving.\n\nYour menstrual cycles seem to have become a bit irregular with a length of 35 days which is a bit more than the average of 26-32 days. This could also be due to the elevated prolactin levels.\n\nWhile having intercourse can sometime trigger menstruation, especially if it's close to your regular period time, it doesn't determine or affect your chances of getting pregnant.\n\nConceiving not only depends on regular menstruation but also on a number of other factors, such as proper ovulation, viable sperm, and optimal condition of the reproductive organs.\n\nYou definitely can conceive in the future. My advice would be to continue the treatment and get regular checks until your prolactin levels are consistently within normal range. If you have been trying to conceive for over a year without success, it might be a good idea to consider a fertility specialist. They can guide you with advanced treatments such as assisted reproductive technologies (ART) like Intrauterine insemination (IUI), In-vitro fertilization (IVF) etc. if necessary and help you conceive.",
    "246": "Hello, the lump you're describing could be a scar tissue, a lipoma (benign fat tissue growth), or a hematoma (blood collection) that has organized and not yet completely resolved. If it's causing discomfort and affecting your confidence, I'd recommend to have it examined by your doctor. An ultrasound might be necessary to determine its exact nature. After diagnosis, possible treatment options include surgical removal, steroid injections to reduce size, or liposuction depending on the nature of the lump. Please don't worry, everyone's health concerns are important and it's never a bother. Your comfort and health are my top priorities. Do get it checked and don't hesitate in reaching out if you have any more questions. Take care.",
    "247": "Hello Aubrey,\n\nFor your back issue, it sounds like you have a condition known as kyphosis or a 'hunchback' posture. This can sometimes be corrected by strengthening the back muscles and improving posture. Specific exercises and stretches can help. These include the 'chest stretch', 'seated row', 'back extensions', and 'planking'. Physical therapy sessions under the supervision of a qualified physiotherapist might be of additional benefit. In severe cases, a brace could be recommended. \n\nOn to your second issue. Chronic nasal congestion could be due to a number of causes like allergies, nasal polyps, sinus infection, deviated septum, etc. You may benefit from a nasal spray or antihistamines if an allergy is the cause. Nasal strips may also work temporarily. If the blockage persists, you should consult with an ENT specialist as you may require more specific treatments such as surgical intervention in case of polyps or a severely deviated septum.\n\nPersistent mouth breathing while sleeping can cause issues like dry mouth and increase the risk of infections. You should get evaluated soon. Until then, staying well hydrated and using a humidifier while sleeping might help relieve your symptoms.\n\nPlease note that while I've tried to give you a broad overview, you should consult a healthcare provider to get a more precise diagnosis and treatment options.",
    "248": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your accident. Numbness on the left side of your face may indeed indicate that a nerve has been compressed or injured, possibly due to the hairline fracture at your zygomatic bone. It might take some time for the nerve to heal and regain its normal function.\n\nMurokind-G is typically prescribed to promote nerve health as it contains a combination of Methylcobalamin (a form of Vitamin B12), Alpha Lipoic Acid, and Gabapentin, which are known to nourish and repair nerve cells. \n\nHowever, if the numbness doesn't improve or gets worse, I would advise you to revisit your doctor. Further investigations like Nerve Conduction Studies or an MRI may be needed to assess the extent of nerve damage or to adjust the treatment plan. Please ensure that you continue to rest and avoid any activities that might exacerbate the injury.\n\nThis is a long healing process, so please be patient and follow your doctor's advice. Keep taking the medication as prescribed and hopefully, the feeling in the affected area will gradually return.",
    "249": "Hello, \nSince the course of antibiotics has finished, it's recommended to follow your doctor's advice and stop the antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics can lead to resistant bacteria. It’s understandable you are concerned the symptoms might return - this is something you should discuss with your doctor. Perhaps he or she can suggest an alternative treatment plan. \n\nRegarding the bowel movements, you should add more fiber in your diet and keep yourself well-hydrated to regulate your bowel movements.\n\nIf your elevated heart rate persists, it's best to check this with your doctor or a cardiologist as it could be a sign of an underlying issue that would need to be addressed. \n\nYou mentioned that you have GERD which is a chronic condition. Long term management plan needs to be considered. Proton pump inhibitors can provide symptomatic relief, but lifestyle modifications will also be very important. \n\nChanges like eating smaller meals, avoiding lying down or going to bed soon after meals, elevating the head of the bed, and avoiding foods and drinks that can trigger reflux, such as spicy foods, onion, citrus, tomato, chocolate, mint, garlic, caffeine, and alcohol, can all help to manage GERD symptoms. \n\nPlease do follow up with your doctor to discuss these issues in detail and form a comprehensive management plan.",
    "250": "I'm sorry to hear your grandson is going through such a tough time. From what you described, it does sound like he is experiencing some symptoms of depression. Depression in adolescents can include symptoms like persistent feelings of sadness, irritability or anger, withdrawal from previously enjoyed activities and friends, decline in school performance, changes in weight or sleep patterns, trouble concentrating, and excessive time playing video games or other activities used to \"escape\" from reality. A significant change in his academic performance might also be an indication of an underlying issue. However, we should avoid diagnosing him without having him thoroughly assessed by a professional.\n\nThese symptoms need to be present for at least two weeks for it to be considered clinical depression but even if it is not, a therapist or counselor could certainly help him. Most schools have psychologists or counselors who can be of help, and seeking out a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist in your personal situation who specializes in adolescent mental health would be a good first step. Regular family doctor or pediatrician can also provide a preliminary evaluation and referral to a mental health specialist if necessary. A mental health professional will be able to evaluate him and provide recommendations for treatment, if needed, which could include things like psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy are two treatments that have been effective for teens), medication, or a combination of both.\n\nIt's important to approach him with compassion and understanding, reassure him that what he's going through is something that others experience and that help is available",
    "251": "Hello. I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way. While it's exceedingly rare, there is a phenomenon called \"stress cardiomyopathy\" or \"broken heart syndrome\" where a severe shock or stress can cause heart symptoms. However, these symptoms typically mimic those of a heart attack and come on directly after the stressor. However, the sustained chest and arm discomfort you're describing can't be disregarded given your age and gender. \n\nIf this discomfort in your chest has lingered for a while, it would be wise to seek immediate medical attention. There's no easy way for me to conduct a proper examination or to assure your situation isn't serious online. Hence, you should consult with a healthcare provider promptly to rule out any potential heart-related issues. Always remember that it's better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to potential heart-related issues.",
    "252": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your mother's condition and the stress you're experiencing. From your description, it sounds like the itchy bumps could potentially be hives, which can be triggered by various factors including stress, certain medications, foods, or unknown factors. Hives are generally harmless but can cause discomfort due to the itching. Over-the-counter antihistamines can help manage the itch. Moisturizing lotions or creams can also provide relief. If these bumps persist, increase in number, or are accompanied by other symptoms like fever, you should consider seeing a healthcare professional for an appropriate evaluation and management. It may not be related to insect bites unless you recall being exposed to insects. However, understanding the exact cause depends on further evaluation and potentially a physical examination. Please take care and seek medical help if necessary.",
    "253": "Hi, thanks for your question. The symptoms you're describing (dizziness, vision changes and impaired hearing) could possibly be due to a drop in blood pressure or blood sugar levels, especially after an intense workout. However, given your history of a heart murmur, it's important to rule out any cardiac issues. While your symptoms aren't classic of a heart problem, sometimes women can experience different symptoms than men. Please consult with a medical professional, you may require an EKG or stress test to ensure there isn't any underlying cardiac issue. Also, make sure you are well hydrated and eating a balanced meal before exercising. Always warm up before and cool down after your workouts to help your body adjust to the changes in activity level. \n\nAgain, these are just suggestions. It's important to get a proper assessment on your situation from a medical professional.",
    "254": "Hello,\nIf you have a late menstrual cycle and suspect you may be pregnant, it is important to first confirm the pregnancy before you take any action. If you want to terminate the pregnancy, mifepristone and misoprostol can be used, but it should always be under the supervision of a medical professional to ensure safety and completeness of the process.\n\nThese drugs are usually effective up to 12 weeks gestation and can be safely used for medical abortion. However, using these drugs without medical supervision may increase the risk for complications including excessive bleeding, infection, or an incomplete abortion.\n\nIt is very important to have a follow-up with a healthcare provider to ensure the process was completed and there are no retained products in the uterus.\n\nIf you are planning for a future pregnancy, it may be wise to consider using a reliable form to contraception which can also be discussed during your visit with a healthcare provider.\n \nI strongly recommend you to consult your gynecologist before taking these tablets.",
    "255": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your brother's situation. Since he has been diagnosed with Hepatitis A and his bilirubin level is high, it suggests he is experiencing a severe form of the condition. Bilirubin is a waste product that remains in the bloodstream when the liver can't properly break it down. This can cause signs and symptoms like yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) and itching (pruritus).\n\nAlthough MRCP is normal, an endoscopy may be a good idea. This can provide a more detailed view of the bile and pancreatic ducts and could reveal any blockages or unusual findings that might explain his symptoms.\n\nPlease ensure that he is receiving adequate supportive care - maintaining hydration, balanced nutrition, and avoiding any potential liver toxins (including alcohol and unnecessary medications). It may take some time for his liver to recover, and each person's course with hepatitis A can be different.\n\nUnfortunately, without more detailed information about his condition, I can only give you a general idea. The treating doctors who have the full clinical picture can give you the best advice tailored to his specific case. Make sure to follow up with them regularly, and don't hesitate to ask them any questions or express your concerns.\n",
    "256": "I'm sorry to hear about your discomfort. Your symptoms might be consistent with conditions like hip osteoarthritis, bursitis, tendinitis, muscle strain, or other musculoskeletal issues affecting the hip. In cases like arthritis or bursitis, there may be inflammation in the hip joint that limits your mobility, resulting in your difficulty in raising your leg. I'd strongly advise you to consult with an orthopedic doctor who can evaluate your symptoms more thoroughly. They may suggest physical examinations, and imaging tests, like an X-ray or MRI, may be done for a more in-depth assessment. It's also important to avoid straining the affected area, refrain from movements that cause pain until you've seen a doctor. If pain persists, over-the-counter pain relievers might provide temporary relief until your appointment. Do not hesitate to reach out for any further queries.",
    "257": "Although it may cause a stinging sensation, you can clean the wound with rubbing alcohol. Rinse the wound with warm clean water first. Then, using a cotton ball or swab, gently apply the rubbing alcohol to the cut to disinfect it. After cleaning, apply an antibiotic ointment to promote healing and prevent infection. Then cover with a clean, dry bandage. If the redness around the edges continues or worsens, or if you notice other signs of infection such as yellow pus, increased pain, swelling, or fever, seek medical attention as soon as possible.",
    "258": "ESR, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, is a general measure of inflammation in the body. An elevated ESR could indicate an infection, autoimmune disease, or other inflammatory condition. A level of 17 is slightly elevated for a child, but it can be due to many different things and is not specific to any one condition. \n\nThe lump in your daughter's neck is likely a swollen lymph node, which can also be due to many causes, including infections (like a throat infection or ear infection), immune responses, or less commonly, certain cancers.\n\nA single test can't confirm a diagnosis. The doctor will likely need to consider these test results along with other symptoms and possibly more tests. It's good you have an upcoming appointment. It is important for your daughter's doctor to examine her and comprehend these findings in the context of her symptoms and health history. \n\nRemember, online platforms can give you direction but it's always crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a definitive diagnosis.",
    "259": "Hyperarousal can be part of conditions like anxiety disorders, PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), and certain sleep disorders too. Although I'm glad to hear that your anxiety and depression have improved, it feels that the residual hyperarousal is disturbing your sleep. The most effective treatment usually involves a combination of psychological intervention (like cognitive behavioral therapy) and for some, medication.\n\nIn terms of medications, non-addictive options like antidepressants (SSRI's, SNRI's) and atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used. Some types of sedatives or sleep aids could also be beneficial under doctor's supervision.\n\nOn the psychological side, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia can be extremely helpful in managing hyperarousal. This involves managing stress and developing good sleep hygiene habits.\n\nKeep in mind that good physical health habits like regular exercise, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and maintaining a regular sleep schedule can also do wonders to manage your symptoms. You should discuss these options with your healthcare provider to figure out the right treatment plan for you. \n\nRemember that everyone is different, so it may take some time to find the approach that works best for you.",
    "260": "Hello, From your description it does sound like a possible groin strain, but other conditions such as hernias, kidney stones, or issues with the appendicitis or uterus (for women) could also be possibilities. Groin strain or a pulled muscle is usually associated with physical activity or injury and is accompanied by localized pain, swelling and difficulty in moving the leg. However, without a physical examination it's hard to confirm. You mustn't ignore worsening pain. Consult your local GP or a physiotherapist for a thorough examination to identify the cause. For now, rest and avoid any exercise or strenuous physical activity. Applying an ice pack can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Over-the-counter painkillers may provide some relief too. But make sure to seek medical help if the pain doesn't improve or gets worse.\n",
    "261": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Based on your symptoms, it seems like you might be dealing with a fungal infection, otherwise known as jock itch. This condition often presents with itching, redness, small pimple-like bumps, and sometimes a foul odor and stickiness due to sweat and skin breakdown. It’s common in warm, moist areas of the body, like the groin and inner thighs.\n\nYou can start by applying an over-the-counter antifungal cream such as clotrimazole twice daily, maintaining proper hygiene, drying the area thoroughly after every shower, and avoiding tight, non-breathable clothing.\n\nHowever, if the symptoms persist or get worse over the next week, I'd recommend seeing a healthcare provider, as you might require stronger, prescription strength antifungal medication or an alternative treatment if the diagnosis is not a fungal infection. Stay safe, take care.",
    "262": "Hello, yes, you still have a chance of becoming pregnant. After ovulation, which typically occurs at follicle sizes of approximately 18-28mm, an egg is generally viable for 12-24 hours. It appears you had intercourse during your peak fertility period, so you are still within your fertility window. Having sexual intercourse tonight and tomorrow night would also be appropriate, as sperm can survive inside a woman's body for up to five days, and this will maximize the number of sperm present to fertilize an egg. Please remain optimistically cautious, as pregnancy is not guaranteed each cycle even under perfect conditions. It's recommended to continue trying for at least 6-12 months before considering additional fertility evaluations or treatments. Please contact your doctor with any further questions or concerns.\n",

It's important to know that although it can be normal to feel some discomfort and a sensation of the device under your skin after pacemaker implantation, constant pain, burning sensation, exhaustion, and fainting are not normal. The pacemaker's function is to prevent slow heart rhythms that can lead to fatigue and fainting. The feeling of it moving could be due to the device not being secured properly or due to swelling. It's crucial to seek immediate medical attention to ensure the pacemaker is functioning correctly and has not been dislodged, or to rule out any infection or other complication. I advise you to contact your healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency department right away.",
    "264": "From your symptoms, it sounds like you might have experienced a severe food allergy or potentially food poisoning. Both can cause similar symptoms including digestive upset, but food allergies can also cause a drop in blood pressure, shock symptoms, and are more likely to kick in quickly. While it is possible that you are allergic to a specific component in Caribbean lobster that might be not present in North Atlantic lobster, it can also be a preparation or a source issue, such as contamination in the food.\n\nThe best course of action would be to avoid Caribbean lobster for now and consider seeing an allergist. They can perform tests to confirm whether you are indeed allergic to this type of seafood. If it happens again with other types of seafood, seek immediate medical attention.",
    "265": "Hello Mr. Dharmender. I'm sorry to hear about your daughter's condition. Rheumatic arthritis is a complex condition which should be managed with multi-disciplinary approach. \nAllopathic medicine primarily focuses on controlling the symptoms, preventing joint and organ damage, improving physical function and overall well-being of the patient. Medications can be disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, etc.\nAlternative treatments, such as Ayurveda, focuses on balancing the body's energies which might help in providing an overall relief, not just the symptoms. Treatments might be diet changes, exercises focusing on joint movements, herbal treatments, etc.\nHomeopathy also has several remedies that aim to provide relief from the symptoms and might benefit the long-term progression of the disease.\nPlease understand that you should not choose between these treatments but try to achieve a balanced approach. It's important to consult with specialists in each area, discuss with them about the condition and treatment plan and try to maintain a team of doctors working together for a common goal. I would recommend you to continue her allopathic treatment but you can also consult with a well known Ayurvedic and Homeopathic practitioner.\nRemember, in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, treatment is lifelong and goal is to keep symptoms in control and improve quality of life rather than cure. Best of Luck.",
    "266": "Hello Curtis, sorry to hear about your discomfort. It is fairly common to experience altered sense of taste following a major surgery owing to several factors such as anesthesia, medications, diminished saliva production, or even tension and anxiety surrounding the event. Typically, these changes should begin to improve within a few weeks. Since you're finding it easier to take sweet foods, you could try incorporating more fruits, smoothies or nutritional shakes into your diet to ensure you're getting enough nutrients. Also, staying hydrated can help. However, if this persists much longer or if you start losing a significant amount of weight, I would advise you to consult your surgeon or primary care physician to rule out any other underlying problems.",
    "267": "Hello, the symptoms you're explaining sound like you might be experiencing something called pitting edema. This is a condition where pressure applied to the skin leaves an indent for a few seconds before it returns to its normal state.\n\nThis could be due to the fluid build-up associated with the injury you sustained, especially since the swelling seemed to move into the calf and ankle. This might have slowed down the normal lymphatic drainage from the lower leg, leading to the fluid accumulation.\n\nRest, Ice, Compression and Elevation (R.I.C.E.) usually helps with such cases of swelling. However, since your symptoms have persisted, I would strongly advise you to see your healthcare provider or a specialist as soon as possible. They may need to evaluate you and rule out any potential complications like a blood clot, especially if you're at risk or have associated symptoms like warmth, severe pain or redness.\n\nMeanwhile, ensure you're not standing for too long.

Checking his blood pressure could also be noteworthy, since both high and low blood pressure can manifest such symptoms. Please take him to the emergency department to rule out serious conditions.",
    "270": "Your symptoms could certainly be indicative of pulmonary hypertension, but it could also be due to other factors such as your body still recovering from the surgery. The medication you’re currently on, amiodarone, can also increase heart rate. I would recommend discussing these symptoms with your doctor, who may want to do further tests such as an echocardiogram or a right heart catheterization to definitively diagnose pulmonary hypertension. You should seek medical attention promptly if symptoms worsen or are accompanied by fainting, chest pain, or a racing heartbeat. While being short of breath and experiencing fatigue can be common after lung surgery, the ongoing chest pressure and notable increase in heart rate should not be ignored.",
    "271": "Hello, Thanks for your query. The odds of becoming pregnant from what you've described are quite low, but not completely impossible. Semen would need to somehow travel from the anal area into the vaginal area and into the cervix, which would be quite challenging. Generally, pregnancy requires the male sperm to be directly ejaculated into the vagina or near the vaginal entrance so it can swim up and meet an egg ready for fertilization. Your act of wiping and removing the sperm also decreases the chance of pregnancy. \n\nAlthough the chance is low, the only certain way to know you're not pregnant is to take a pregnancy test. I'd advise waiting until after your expected period date, as this is when the test will be most accurate. If your period comes as expected, then you're not pregnant. If you have other physical symptoms or your period is late, I recommend taking a pregnancy test just to be sure. Practice safe sex in future to avoid potential risks.",
    "272": "Hello,\n\nI understand your concern and anxiety. In this situation, even though the risk of pregnancy is very low, it is not absolutely zero. If there was any semen on her fingers when she inserted them into her vagina, there is a theoretical chance of pregnancy. \n\nEmergency contraception (the \"morning-after\" pill, or \"Plan B\") can be taken within 72 hours of intercourse to prevent pregnancy. The earlier it is taken, the more effective it is. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, breast tenderness, headache, dizziness, and fatigue. These symptoms usually go away within 24 hours. Emergency contraceptive pills won’t hurt your girlfriend's health or fertility.\n\nIf she misses her period by more than one week, only then perform a home pregnancy test. If it turns out positive, consult a gynecologist immediately for further advice on termination if you choose to. Always remember, the best way to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases is to use a condom correctly and consistently or abstain from sexual activity.\n\nHope this response is helpful. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me again. Take care.\n\n",

Given your symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, feeling your heart beating hard, and now with the addition of left arm pain, these symptoms should not be ignored. Though stress can indeed cause physical symptoms, the symptoms you describe could possibly be related to your heart, and it's vital to get it properly checked out. I recommend that you seek immediate medical attention - go to the emergency room if the symptoms are ongoing. They can run necessary tests such as an EKG, blood tests, and potentially a stress test or a cardiac echo. Even though your doctor may have previously attributed your symptoms to stress, the development of new symptoms warrants a fresh examination.

    "274": "A resting heart rate of 100-114 per minute is a bit on the high side for a 17-year-old. The typical resting heart rate for adolescents and adults ranges from 60-100 beats per minute. However, a higher resting heart rate could be due to various reasons such as stress, anxiety, dehydration, or lack of sleep. \n\nProlonged sedentary behaviour and poor diet can also impact your heart rate. It's great that you are getting back into being active and eating better. These changes can improve your heart rate over time. \n\nHowever, if your heart rate continues to be consistently over 100 beats per minute at rest, even after improving your lifestyle, I would recommend consulting with a healthcare provider for a complete check-up.

    "275": "It's not uncommon to have temporary numbness in your arms or hands from time to time, especially if you've slept on your arm or had it in an awkward position. However, the persistence and frequency of your symptoms suggests it may be something more than just a positional issue, such as nerve compression. \n\nOne common cause of these types of symptoms is carpal tunnel syndrome, which could cause your hands and fingers to feel numb or \"fall asleep\". Another potential cause could be a condition affecting the neck, such as cervical spondylosis, a type of osteoarthritis, can compress the nerves that go out to your arms and cause these symptoms. \n\nGiven the duration of your symptoms, it'd be useful for you to see your primary care physician or a neurologist for an examination. They can perform tests, such as nerve conduction studies, to help determine if there's a problem with the nerves in your arms. \n\nAdopt good posture while working especially if you work long hours on a keyboard. Avoid resting your wrists on the edge of the keyboard or table while typing, consider using a split-design or \"tented\" keyboard that puts your hands in a more neutral position, and remember to take breaks to stretch and move around.\n\nAlso, evaluate your sleeping positions.

In rare cases, it could indicate something more serious like cancer, but it's important to remember that this is not the most common cause.\n\nHowever, any new lump should always be evaluated by a doctor. If you start to experience other symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, or the lump grows in size or becomes fixed (not movable), you should seek urgent medical attention.

However, if you are still concerned, it wouldn't hurt to take a home pregnancy test just for peace of mind. If you continue to have absent periods, despite being on birth control, it might be worth discussing further with your doctor to rule out any potential hormonal imbalances or other underlying conditions.

    "282": "Hello, welcome to ChatDoctor. Tretinoin cream is indeed effective in managing the signs of aging like fine lines, wrinkles and uneven skin tone. It works by promoting skin cell turnover and stimulating collagen production. But, it's also powerful and may cause some initial irritation like redness, peeling, or dryness. Here are some tips:\n1. Start slowly: Use the cream every other night for the first 2 weeks, and then increase to nightly as tolerated. \n2. Combine with moisturizer: Apply your night cream first and then the tretinoin cream. This can create a barrier between the medication and your skin and minimize irritation. \n3. Use sunscreen: Tretinoin can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, and sun damage can actually accelerate the aging process. Using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher each day is a must.\n4. Small amounts: A small pea-sized amount of tretinoin is enough for the whole face. Applying more won't lead to faster or better results.\n5.

However, it would not directly cause high blood pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, anxiety due to the discomfort of these urinary symptoms can contribute to temporary rises in blood pressure. Furthermore, some medications used to treat symptoms of enlarged prostate can also interact with blood pressure, so it's important to discuss all your symptoms and any medications you take with your doctor.\n\nUnderlying both high blood pressure and BPH, lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, alcohol, smoking, and stress level also play a critical role. Management of both conditions often involves addressing these factors.  \n\nDiscuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider who can guide you in the right direction and make a plan for addressing both of these issues. Regular monitoring and medication, if necessary, can help control high blood pressure and reduce the symptoms of an enlarged prostate.\n\nPlease remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with your healthcare provider for appropriate examinations, treatment, testing, and care recommendations.",
    "284": "Hello. The feeling of \"rolling contractions\" in your stomach might be due to various reasons such as gas, indigestion, or perhaps a bacterial or viral infection. It could also be related to your menstrual cycle or some other gynaecological issues. However, without knowing your medical history and conducting a physical examination, it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause.\n\nAs for the painful pimple on your labia majora, it's likely a blocked sweat gland or hair follicle, which can occur due to sweating or bacterial infection. Popping it might cause an infection, so it's generally recommended against doing so. Keep the area clean. You may use a warm compress on it a few times a day to help with pain and promote healing. Avoid sexual intercourse until it's healed.\n\nIf the symptoms for either of these issues persist or get worse, please seek medical attention. It would be best to consult with a healthcare provider directly who can evaluate your symptoms properly and provide suitable treatment.",
    "285": "Hello, and thank you for trusting us with your health question. Prostate enlargement or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is common among men as they age and it can cause symptoms like frequent urination, difficulty starting and stopping urination, and, in some cases, blood in the urine. It can sometimes also lead to urinary tract infections or even kidney damage. It's important to note that this condition is not prostate cancer and it doesn't increase your risk for prostate cancer. Avodart (dutasteride) is a medication that is commonly used to shrink the prostate and alleviate the symptoms. If it doesn't help, there are indeed surgical options available.\n\nHowever, while the bleeding from the prostate is likely due to the enlargement, it could also be a sign of a more serious condition like prostate cancer. While your doctor didn't find any signs of prostate cancer during your cystoscopy, I would still recommend discussing with your doctor about getting a PSA test, which is a blood test used as a screening tool for prostate cancer. While it's not perfect, it could provide more information about what's going on in your case. Please don't hesitate in seeking a second opinion, this is about your health and it's important to address your concerns and take appropriate action. \n\nWishing you the best of health!",

It's better to be cautious in these situations, especially with young children.",
    "287": "Hello, it seems like these lumps could be muscle knots, or what we call \"trigger points.\" These are typically areas of spasm and inflammation in your skeletal muscle. Massaging does help in relieving the tension in these knots, hence the temporary relief after you massage them. Doing stretching exercises, maintaining regular physical activity, and staying hydrated may also help. However, if these lumps persist or become more painful, increase in size or number, or are associated with other symptoms like fever, it would be best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper physical evaluation and treatment. Physical therapy or a referred visit to a rheumatologist (a specialist in muscle conditions) may also be needed.",
    "288": "Hello, you're correct in understanding that Ureaplasma urealyticum is a bacterium that is often sexually transmitted. However, its transmission through saliva is not well-documented and seems less likely. While it's still technically possible, the main transmission modes are typically through sexual intercourse. \n\nTo completely prevent re-infection, doctors usually recommend that both partners get treated before resuming any sexual activities, including kissing. If your partner starts his treatment soon and you both continue to take your medications as directed, you should both be clear of the infection. I would recommend discussing your concerns with your healthcare provider for personalized advice. Your doctor will also consider other factors, like your overall health and other risk factors. \n\nRemember, it's important to complete your course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better, to ensure that the bacteria is completely eradicated from your body. This also reduces the risk of antibiotic resistance. I hope this information is helpful, take care. Let me know if I can assist you further.\n",

Concerning your acne control, Zyclin Nano gel and Retino A are generally effective treatments, but they might not work for everyone. It often takes several weeks (anywhere from 6-12 weeks) for significant improvements to be noticed. \n\nHowever, if you're feeling like these products are causing irritation or increasing your acne, it might be best to reach out to your doctor who prescribed them. They can reassess your skin and consider a different course of treatment, or potentially add another medication to help control your acne. \n\nAs for the red patches, these might be a sign of irritation from the products you're currently using. It's advisable to inform your doctor about them as well to adjust your treatment accordingly.\n\nBe sure to stick with a gentle skin-care routine that includes washing your face twice a day with a mild cleanser, always applying sunscreen, avoiding picking or scratching acne, and maintaining a balanced diet. Regular exercise and proper sleep also contribute to better skin health.",

The treatment of Elephantiasis (lymphedema) generally includes medications like antibiotics to treat any infections, as well as compression therapy and physiotherapy to help improve the lymphatic flow. \n\nIn the USA, there are indeed centers specializing in Lymphatic diseases which may be able to provide you with specialized treatment. Institutes like Stanford Lymphatic and Venous Disorders clinic or Brigham and Women's Hospital have expertise in this field. However, as a chat doctor, I cannot arrange an appointment for you. I would advise reaching out to these hospitals directly to discuss your situation and plan a potential visit. \n\nRemember, it is always important to communicate with and follow the advice of the healthcare team managing your care.

    "292": "Hello dear patient, sorry to hear about your recurring allergy problems. Your symptoms suggest seasonal allergies, also known as allergic rhinitis or hay fever. You should consider taking antihistamines like Cetirizine (10 mg at night) or Loratadine (10 mg at night). However, these medications can cause drowsiness in some people, so please be mindful of that if you're taking them for the first time. Co-administration of a leukotriene inhibitor, such as Montelukast (10 mg at night), might be beneficial as well. Lastly, using a saline nasal spray regularly might help to soothe your nasal passages and ward off irritants or allergens. However, it would be best to see an allergist or immunologist even if these medications do control your symptoms effectively, as allergy shots (immunotherapy) might be a more suitable long-term solution. Please consult with a local healthcare provider before starting any new medication.",
    "293": "Hello. This seems to be a case of food allergy, specifically, chocolate or ingredients in chocolate-based items you've been consuming. Allergies can come and go, and symptoms can change over time. Originally, you had rashes and breathing difficulties, which are typical allergic reactions. Now it seems like your reaction to chocolate is more mild, causing only headaches. \n\nThis is potentially due to your body's immune system response changing over time. However, a headache is not a typical allergic reaction and might be due to something else, like sugar content in the chocolate or a sensitivity to certain ingredients, such as caffeine, present in the chocolate.\n\nI'd advise you to avoid chocolate if it's causing discomfort. If you're curious to see if you're still allergic or if you're experiencing migraines or another condition, I recommend consulting with your primary doctor for further testing and evaluation. \n\nPlease note it's important to seek immediate medical attention if you ever have difficulty breathing after consuming chocolate or any other food, as it could be an indication of a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.",

If you experience any severe cramping, heavier bleeding, or feel faint or dizzy, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.",

The menstrual cramps you're experiencing might be a pre-menstrual sign that your period is about to start. Hormonal fluctuations after childbirth can also make your periods irregular, which might explain why you've missed a period. If you're still concerned, you could take a home pregnancy test for confirmation. However, if you want to avoid pregnancy, it would be ideal to use a reliable form of contraception. It's also advisable to speak to a healthcare provider about suitable contraception methods post childbirth. Hope this helps.",

It sounds like your mother may be experiencing hallucinations, which can sometimes be a side effect of Parkinson's disease or its medications. Melzap, which is a brand name for the drug Alprazolam, is commonly used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. This can sometimes help if the hallucinations are causing significant distress and anxiety. However, it's crucial to monitor her closely if she starts this medication, as it can sometimes cause side effects such as drowsiness, light-headedness, and confusion, which might exacerbate some symptoms of Parkinson's. Consultation with her neurologist or psychiatrist regarding the benefits and risks is essential. I would suggest considering a comprehensive review of her medication regimen by her treating doctor, considering the possibility of medication-induced hallucinations.",
    "297": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about the discomfort you're experiencing. From what you describe, \"knee giving out\" can be due to several reasons including degeneration of the knee joint, weak muscles supporting the knee or ligamentous injury inside the knee. This tends to occur more frequently as we age and also in individuals who have arthritis. If this is happening frequently, it may be worthwhile to consider getting an evaluation with a physical therapist or an orthopedic surgeon to understand your knee stability and look for any red flags which may increase the risk of falls. \n\nMore often than not, strengthening exercises targeted toward improving the muscle strength surrounding the knee joint can help prevent these episodes of knee instability. You may also benefit from use of assistive devices like a cane or a walker if your gait is unstable. Physical therapy can help instruct you on proper use of these devices and optimize your mobility.\n\nRemember this advice is intended to give a broad perspective and it may or may not entirely apply to you.

    "298": "Your symptoms may be related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition where stomach acid or, occasionally, bile flows back (refluxes) into your food pipe (esophagus). The backwash irritates the lining of your esophagus and may cause symptoms like a dry cough, difficulty swallowing and the sensation of a lump in your throat.\n\nGERD is worse at night as the lack of gravity can cause the stomach contents to flow upward. Drinking water helps because it can dilute the acid and temporarily alleviate the issue.\n\nOver-the-counter antacids may help, but it's important to not use them frequently as they have side effects. If your symptoms persist, you should consult with a gastroenterologist who may prescribe medications such as H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors. \n\nOther treatments involve making lifestyle changes such as losing weight if you're overweight, elevating the head of your bed, avoiding food that trigger your heartburn and not eating before bedtime.\n\nFurthermore, it's still important to consult a pulmonologist to rule out any lung conditions. Although you haven't mentioned any risk factors for lung disease, it's good to get a thorough examination and, potentially, a pulmonary function test to ensure that your lungs are healthy.",

If the thyroglossal cyst is not causing any symptoms and is not enlarging, it is typically monitored without immediate treatment. But, if the cyst is causing symptoms or enlarging, surgery may be recommended.

The dosage you've described - 500 mg, three times daily for a week - is a common regimen for a tooth infection.

Be sure to make an appointment with a dentist to get the tooth looked at as soon as possible.\n\nIn terms of when to take the amoxicillin, this should be spaced evenly throughout the day, every 8 hours or so. It can be taken with or without food, but taking it with food may reduce possible side effects, like stomach upset.\n\nPlease understand that this is just advice based on the information provided and it's recommended to follow the advice of your healthcare professional.

Pain associated with a pronounced sensitivity to cold typically indicates an inflamed pulp or pulpitis, a condition often caused by tooth decay.

Additionally, a constantly running fan can also trigger allergies if there's dust on the fan or in the air. If the fan is directly facing him all night, it can lead to muscle stiffness or soreness due to the continued exposure to the breeze. To minimize these potential issues, consider using a fan with adjustable settings and keeping it at a medium or low setting rather than high.

    "315": "Hello,\nIn cases of dog bites, immediate washing and cleaning of the wound with soap and water is highly beneficial, which should then be followed by vaccine administration. While it's good your mother received a tetanus shot, she should also start rabies vaccination immediately after the bite, not later.\n\nThe typical schedule for rabies vaccine is on the day of the exposure, and then again on days 3, 7, and 14 after the first injection. Note that this schedule can vary depending upon the specific vaccine being used.\n\nIt's also important to monitor the dog for 10 days to see if it shows any signs of rabies. If your dog remains healthy for 10 days after the bite, it means it was not shedding the virus when it bit your mom.\n\nHowever, This advice is standard for bites from dogs whose vaccination status is unknown or for unvaccinated dogs. As your dog was previously vaccinated, it is less likely to be a risk but since the vaccine isn't up to date, it's safer to act as though the dog was unvaccinated.\n\nSo, to answer, ideally rabies vaccine should be started immediately, not after three days. Please consult with your healthcare provider regarding this matter.\n",

The itching (pruritus) in patients with End Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) is often due to the accumulation of bile salts in the blood and tissues, due to the liver's reduced ability to clear them. \n\nHigh bilirubin levels, such as in your case, are also a marker of significant liver dysfunction. Management of itching in liver disease can be complex as over the counter drugs often don't give full relief. \n\nThe medications that are commonly used include cholestyramine, a drug that binds bile salts in your intestines and stops them from being reabsorbed back into your blood. Other medications that can be used include rifampin (an antibiotic which also affects bile salt transport), naltrexone (which works on opiate receptors that are thought to be part of the itch signaling pathway), and sertraline (an antidepressant which helps some patients with the itching component). \n\nAlso, UVB phototherapy may help for refractory itching. \n\nThese treatments can only be initiated upon consultation with your hepatologist or primary care provider, as they each have potential side effects that must be considered in the context of your overall health status. \n\nRemember to keep skin moisturized and avoid hot showers (opt for lukewarm water instead) - heat can make itching worse. Try to be patient and communicate openly with your healthcare team about your symptoms and how they impact your life.",
    "322": "Hello, it's quite possible that your current medications might not be enough to control your blood pressure or it could be that some lifestyle factors are causing your BP to rise. The giddy feeling may be due to your B12 deficiency. Since you're experiencing some bothersome side effects I would suggest making an appointment with your primary care doctor to discuss these issues. He or she may decide to adjust the medications, add a B12 supplement, or suggest diet changes, among other things, to help manage your conditions. It's good that you're noticing these changes so that they can be addressed promptly. Remember to keep a track of your symptoms to share with your doctor during the consult.",
    "323": "Hello, it's understandable that you're worried, and I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you're facing. Unexplained infertility can be very frustrating. As per your description, spotting before your period doesn't seem to be a problem in itself, but it could be a symptom of an underlying condition that might affect your fertility, like hormonal imbalances or polyps. It might be worth discussing this with your gynecologist in more detail. Also, especially with unexplained infertility, timing can be critical. Even with using ovulation kits, it's recommended that you have regular intercourse (about 2-3 times a week) throughout your cycle, not just during the perceived 'fertility window'. Stay positive and continue to consult with your healthcare provider to explore all available options. You might want to consider assisted reproductive technologies like IVF if you haven't already.",
    "324": "I completely understand your concern. It's not unusual for children that age to have visible bumps and lumps in the jaw area. There could be numerous harmless reasons behind this abnormality, such as the development of permanent teeth or swollen lymph nodes due to a mild infection or even a cyst. It could simply be a part of your child's normal anatomy. However, if you are genuinely concerned about its presence, it is crucial to get a physical examination done by a pediatrician or a pediatric dentist. They may recommend some imaging tests to confirm the nature of the lump. Keep in mind that tumors or cancers in children are extremely rare, hence it's best not to jump to conclusions. However, staying on the side of precaution is advisable, so do arrange for an appointment. Your child's health and wellness are our utmost priority.",
    "325": "Hi, it certainly sounds like you're in a significant amount of discomfort and it's affecting your day to day life. The symptoms may suggest several things, from gastrointestinal issues such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome, to gynaecological conditions such as ovarian cysts. The feeling of \"tearing\" and the nausea especially after eating are concerning symptoms.  I would definitely recommend you see a doctor as soon as possible. They can perform a physical exam, and be able to refer you for further testing if necessary, such as an ultrasound. Your health is important so don't delay seeking medical help.",
    "326": "Green stool can sometimes be a normal variation, particularly if you've been consuming foods or beverages with green pigments. However, in your case, since you have undergone a cholecystectomy and are experiencing abdominal pain, you should seek medical advice as this can also be due to an increase in bile that's no longer being stored in the gallbladder and spills into the intestines. If pain persists or you experience other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fever, or yellowing of skin and eyes, seek immediate medical attention as this could indicate an infection or other more serious complication.",
    "327": "Hello, the clear, non-urine liquid you are seeing is likely pre-ejaculate or \"pre-cum\". This is a common occurrence in males, especially during times of sexual excitement. It is a natural bodily function, produced by the Cowper's glands and its role is to neutralize the acidic environment in the urethra and provide a lubricating fluid during sexual arousal. If you're experiencing this consistently after urination and it's causing you distress, it might be a good idea to discuss this with a urologist or your primary care doctor. You could potentially have a condition such as prostatitis, which is an inflammation or infection of the prostate gland, but this would typically cause other symptoms such as difficulty urinating or pelvic pain. Drinking plenty of water and urinating regularly can help to clear the substances out of the urethra.",
    "328": "Hi and thanks for your query. High WBC count, especially if persistent and in your case accompanied by low platelets and blood in urine definitely suggests that there could be a more serious condition ongoing. Although the root cause of high WBC is sometimes difficult to determine and might fluctuate in levels, it might be appropriate and very necessary to do a complete evaluation in your case. \n\nA cause of bleeding should be sought for in your case as blood in urine should never be taken lightly. In some cases, high WBC count can be due to some cancers like leukemia, or myeloproliferative diseases. But it's also often seen in less serious conditions such as inflammation or infections.\n\nSmoking can only explain the WBCs to some extent but not the other parameters like low platelets and blood in urine. It seems you may need a comprehensive evaluation by a hematologist and possibly a nephrologist. A renal ultrasound, urinalysis, and perhaps even a bone marrow biopsy might be necessary depending on the physical exam and review of your history. \n\nIt sounds like your concerns are not being fully addressed and that you are not getting clear information. It is likely beneficial to get a second opinion from another hematologist if your current one is unable to figure out a diagnosis or if you're not comfortable with their approach to your care. You should certainly continue to be monitored and perhaps the interval should be shortened to less than three months, given your symptoms.\n\nPlease remember that early",
    "329": "Hello. Moles are common and usually harmless, but in some cases, they can become problematic. Any changes to a mole, including itchiness, pain, changes in color or size, or any bleeding should be evaluated by a medical professional. Although it might not be anything serious, it is possible a mole could be a sign of skin cancer. It's always better to be safe than sorry and get it checked out by a dermatologist to rule out any major issues. In the meantime, try to avoid scratching the mole and keep an eye on any changes. I hope this helps!",
    "330": "Your daughter's symptoms could be suggestive of several conditions such as gastritis, a peptic ulcer, or gallbladder issues (though this is less likely given her age). The light-headedness, almost-blackout, and involuntary twitches are concerning, and may relate to significant weight loss, possible deficient intake of essential nutrients, dehydration or even over-exercising.\n\nGiven these symptoms, my advice is that she should actually see a doctor in-person for a detailed examination including blood tests and other investigations as required. In the meantime, ensure that she is drinking enough fluids, eating a balanced diet (including carbohydrates and proteins), and is resting adequately. If she begins to have repeated episodes of feeling faint or blacking out, experience prolonged symptom persistence, or any new worrisome symptom develops, please seek immediate medical care.",
    "331": "Hello. Given your history of recurrent oral yeast infections, and the fact that you've recently had a viral illness which could have upset the balance of healthy microbes in your mouth, it could indeed be a new onset of oral thrush. Antifungal treatments like Nystatin are generally needed, as oral thrush can be persistent and may not resolve on its own. Please reach out to your healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms and consider treatment. In addition, eating yogurt or taking a probiotic supplement may help restore healthy microbial balance in your mouth. Nonetheless, it's important to speak with your doctor about this.\n",
    "332": "Breathing in steam from hot water mixed with feces can potentially expose you to bacteria or other pathogens in the feces that are aerosolized by the hot water. This can potentially cause respiratory infections if the pathogens are inhaled and infect your respiratory tract. However, the risk is generally low, especially if it was a one-time thing. \n\nStill, it's a good practice to avoid this in the future. To clean containers used for stool samples, use gloves and wash with soap and cold or lukewarm water without directly inhaling above the container.\n\nIf you develop symptoms such as cough, fever, or shortness of breath, seek medical attention immediately as these could be signs of a respiratory infection. It's always better to be cautious and take appropriate measures.",
    "333": "I understand your concern. The numbness in your toes and thumb might not be related and could have different causes. The numbness in your toes could be due to nerve damage from the injury or could be the beginning of peripheral neuropathy. Since your father has peripheral neuropathy, you could have a genetic predisposition to it. \n\nHowever, the numbness in your thumb could be due to a problem in the neck if it's resulting from nerve compression, which can happen due to obesity or poor posture.\n\nBlood sugar levels should be checked, as undiagnosed diabetes is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy. Also, I recommend getting complete blood count checked as deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals like vitamin B12, vitamin D, and iron, can also cause numbness.\n\nConsider getting a referral for a neurologist, who can perform nerve conduction studies and an EMG, which can help evaluate the health of your nerves. \n\nTo help prevent further nerve damage, maintaining a healthy weight, regular exercise, and good posture are important. \n\nSmoking and high alcohol intake can also increase the risk of nerve damage, so if applicable, try to quit smoking and limit alcohol intake. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains can also support nerve health.\n\nPlease discuss these points with your GP and consider all necessary tests and specialist referral.",
    "334": "Hello, it appears that the bumps you're referring to are likely the result of tissue trauma from your fall, and they could be areas where the body is still healing. Sometimes, a semi-permanent lump can develop after a deep tissue injury, which may take months to go away.\n\nThe first action you can continue is taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, which may help reduce the swelling and promote healing. Warm compresses applied to the affected area for 15-20 minutes a few times a day can also help increase blood flow and facilitate the body's healing response.\n\nRemember to avoid further trauma to the area to prevent further delay in healing. If you see little to no reductions or improvements in 6-8 weeks or if the lump continues to grow, a visit to a healthcare professional is recommended. They might need to evaluate if there is a small pocket of fluid or blood (a hematoma or a cyst) that might need to be drained to speed up the healing process.\n\nA follow-up may also be needed if you develop new symptoms such as redness, warmth, increasing pain, or notable skin changes over the lumps. Remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate examination, diagnosis, and treatment.",
    "335": "Hello,\n\nFrom the sounds of it, it seems like you're doing all the correct things at the moment. However, given that you're currently on antibiotics, it's concerning that you're still experiencing pain and pus oozing from the wound. \n\nThis might suggest a severe infection, or possibly an abscess, which is a collection of pus in one area. If this is the case, the pus would need to be drained for the infection to clear, which typically requires a small surgical procedure.\n\nUnfortunately, due to this, it would be best if you sought an in-person medical consultation as soon as possible. Wound inspection and appropriate treatment by a doctor are essential in this case. You should not delay this matter as leaving an infection untreated can lead to more severe complications like cellulitis or sepsis. \n\nTake care and all the best in your recovery.",
    "336": "Hello, sorry to hear that you are in pain. From your description, it seems like you might have a condition called sciatica, which is often caused by a herniated disc in the lower spine. This can cause lower back pain and can often radiate to the groin and legs.\n\nThe pain during ejaculation could be related to this spinal issue, as there are nerves in the region that regulate the sexual organs. However, it could also be a separate issue entirely. If your prostate is clear, other possible causes of pain during ejaculation could be infections, inflammation, or even psychological issues.\n\nI would recommend that you try to get a referral to a neurologist or an orthopedic surgeon who can investigate the back and sciatica issue further. Advanced imaging such as MRI could be beneficial to evaluate your back more closely. Physiotherapy could also be considered if deemed appropriate by your doctor.\n\nRegarding the pain during ejaculation, a visit to a urologist for further assessment might be useful to rule out any other cause if you haven't done so. It's important that you let your doctors know all the symptoms you have so they can make the most accurate diagnosis. \n\nPlease remember that even though it's stressful to not have definitive answers, it sometimes takes a little time and patience to figure out exactly what's going on. I hope this information helps guide you and assist your discussions with your healthcare providers.",
    "337": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well. Dark brown vomit can indeed be caused by an issue with your liver, as it might be due to the presence of blood that has been denatured by gastric acid. This is often referred to as \"coffee ground vomitus,\" due to its similar appearance. Elevated liver enzymes can indicate inflammation or damage to your liver cells, and can result from several conditions, including alcohol consumption, certain medications such as statins, viral hepatitis, and obesity. It's good to see that your healthcare provider is already investigating this issue. It's important to closely follow their advice during this time for further management and get regular check-ups until your condition stabilizes.",
    "338": "Hello, The frequent urination, together with the lower abdominal pain and lower back pain, seems to suggest that you may have a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs are usually characterized by frequent urges to urinate with little urine coming out, and such a condition often comes with lower abdominal pain and/or lower back pain. I would recommend that you see a doctor as soon as possible to have this diagnosed and treated appropriately. A urine test can be done to determine whether or not this is actually a UTI. Concerning the unprotected sexual intercourse, if pregnancy is a concern for you, it's important to remember that sperm can survive in the female reproductive tract for up to five days. If you ovulated during that time, it's possible that sperm may have fertilized the egg. Should there be a delay in the expected period, it would be advisable to have a pregnancy test just to make sure. Please remember to use contraceptives in the future to avoid unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).",
    "339": "Hello. Staphylococcus aureus infection in your semen could potentially be causing both the increase in dead sperm and the presence of pus cells. It represents an infection and could impact sperm health, motility, and can cause inflammation and elevated levels of white blood cells (pus cells). \n\nYou would need antibiotics to treat this infection. Staphylococcus aureus can be resistant to some antibiotics, which makes it crucial for your physician to choose the right one. Please consult with your urologist or infertility specialist for an appropriate antibiotic treatment.\n\nThere are also other factors that can affect the health of your sperm, such as smoking, alcohol, stress, poor diet, and certain medications. You should discuss all of these possibilities with your healthcare provider.\n\nAfter completion of your treatment, it would be advisable to repeat the semen analysis to evaluate the motility and amount of dead sperm. It may also be helpful to have your partner checked for any fertility issues, if not done already, to rule out any other potential causes of difficulty in conception. Hope this helps!",
    "340": "Hello, thank you for asking on Chat Doctor. It may very well be from your non-acidic reflux disease. What happens in reflux is that substances (either acid or non-acidic materials) from your stomach travel back up your esophagus. When this happens, the lining in your throat can become irritated and produce excess phlegm. \n\nHowever, it's also possible your increased phlegm production could be related to allergies, irritants, or even a low-grade infection. Advise from here would be:\n\n1. Continue taking your reflux medication as prescribed.\n2. Try to avoid known triggers for reflux such as eating large or fatty meals, drinking alcohol or caffeine, or smoking.\n3. If your symptoms continue to worsen or are accompanied by other changes such as trouble breathing, a significant change in voice, weight loss, or symptom persistence after lifestyle modifications and medication, you should definitely seek further medical care. \n\nAt any point, if you feel seriously ill please seek immediate medical attention.",
    "341": "Thank you for your message. The development of a pregnancy is variable and can differ from one woman to another. Therefore, while some women may see specific details (such as the gestational sac and yolk sac) on an ultrasound around five to six weeks of gestation, others may not see these structures until a bit later. The timing of your cycle and insemination suggests you're around close to six weeks pregnant, but it can differ by a few days depending on the exact timing of implantation. \n\nNext week, you should expect to see more development within the gestational sac and possibly a yolk sac or a fetal pole, which is the first visible sign of the embryo. It's important to note every woman and every pregnancy is different, and sometimes these things might not be visible until a bit later. \n\nI encourage you to continue open communication with your healthcare provider, expressing any concerns and questions you may have so that you can receive appropriate care. If you feel that your current doctor isn't listening or addressing your concerns, it could be worth seeking a second opinion.",
    "342": "Hello. Distention of the abdomen may be due to many different reasons including swallowing air (common with anxiety or fast eating), certain foods and beverages, constipation, weight gain, hormonal fluctuation, irritable bowel syndrome, and even tumors. If the distension is new and associated with discomfort, bloating or excessive belching, it may be due to a functional issue like slow motility or even a bacterial overgrowth in the gut. Given that your symptoms seem to worsen throughout the day, bloating due to slow transit or bacterial overgrowth seems plausible. \n\nSince you've had some tests that rule out certain conditions like Celiac disease, you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. They might suggest a trial of a probiotic or a gut motility drug, and dietary modifications like smaller more frequent meals and reduction of foods that can cause gas, like beans, broccoli, onions, and carbonated drinks. \n\nThe sensation of something stuck in your throat or chest might be due to GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). In this condition, the stomach acid or bile irritates the food pipe lining. This leads to heartburn and can give you a feeling of uneasiness or something stuck when there's nothing.\n\nEven though stress isn't the primary cause of your symptoms, it can contribute to them and sometimes even make them worse. Hence, keep your stress levels in check with relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation or any of your favorite hobbies. \n\nRemember to",

The symptoms you're describing may be due to a variety of causes, which could range from fatigue, stress, anxiety to more physical issues like anemia, Vitamin deficiency, or low blood sugar. It might be a good idea to start with some basic blood tests, including a complete blood count, blood sugar, vitamin levels and thyroid function tests. Please also let me know if you have any other symptoms like headaches, blurred vision, difficulty speaking or moving any parts of your body, weight changes, or change in sleep or appetite. Mental fog can also be caused by poor sleep quality or duration, even if you feel like you're getting enough sleep. Don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional in case you're feeling excessively stressed or anxious. Please consult with a healthcare professional in person in order to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Remember, taking care of your mind is as important as taking care of your body.",

    "347": "Hello Laura, Welcome to Chat Doctor. The symptoms you're describing - feeling of food getting stuck, discomfort in the chest area, excessive mucus production - suggest a condition known as esophageal dysphagia. This can stem from a variety of causes such as esophageal stricture (narrowing of the esophagus due to chronic inflammation), acid reflux disease (GERD), or esophageal motility disorders (difficulties in the contraction and relaxation process that propel food through the esophagus).\n\nI would advise you to consult with a gastroenterologist for a proper evaluation. Tests such as upper GI endoscopy or a barium swallow study can help understand the underlying cause. Meanwhile, try to eat smaller and more frequent meals, chew food thoroughly, and avoid lying down immediately after eating. Acid reflux symptoms can be managed by antacids or proton pump inhibitors, which are over-the-counter medications. \n\nHowever, it is important to remember not to self diagnose or self medicate, and consult with a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and appropriate treatment strategy.",
    "348": "Hello. Sorry to hear about your problem. The normal belly button (navel) in adults appears as a small hole or depression at the center of the abdomen with surrounding skin. Most of the time there is no visible \"red cord\" within the belly button, which is typically a remnant of the umbilical cord that usually disappears shortly after birth. It looks like you are having recurrent umbilical issues. The red cord you're noticing may be granulation tissue, which often forms in response to an infection or inflammation, or due to foreign body response. It seems your doctor's diagnosis is reasonable. It is important to follow the instructions and take antibiotics as prescribed. If it's not healed in the prescribed time, an operation might be the best way to prevent future issues. It is a minor operation and recovery is typically good. Please don't panic, and discuss your concerns with your surgeon. They can guide you in the best possible way.",
    "349": "Hello RJ, I'm Dr. ChatDoctor and I'm here to help.\n\n1. Regarding your masturbation habits: Masturbation is a completely normal behavior and can actually contribute to healthy sexual behavior. However, like anything, moderation is key. When it becomes excessive and it's affecting your daily life–like if you're skipping work or responsibilities to do it, or if it's causing upset or distress, it's recommended to seek professional help. But based on your description, it seems your habit is not concerning.\n\n2. Will it reduce health level: Excessive masturbation doesn't affect your health, energy levels, vitality, or cause any long-term effect on your sperm count or semen. However, in the short term, your sperm count may reduce slightly due to frequent ejaculation, but it will get replenished.\n\n3. About health of future kids: There's no scientific evidence to prove that frequent masturbation can lead to genetic or health problems in your future children.\n\nHere are your requested tips:\n1. To improve sperm health: Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, keep a healthy weight, don't smoke, limit alcohol, minimize stress and avoid exposure to toxins. \n2. To control masturbation: Find a hobby or pastime to keep your mind busy. Reading, sports, or any form of exercise can help.

    "351": "Good morning. Psoriasis can be a difficult condition to manage, especially when it involves the scalp. \n\nFor scalp psoriasis, generally, a comprehensive approach combining topical treatments, oral medications, and non-prescription remedies is taken to provide the most relief. \n\n1. Cleanse with a Tar or Salicylic Acid Shampoo: Shampoos containing tar or salicylic acid can help to reduce the speed at which skin cells grow, thus minimizing the presence of scales. These ingredients can also help to soothe itching and inflammation. \n\n2. Topical corticosteroids: These are commonly used to treat psoriasis and are typically the first treatment for scalp psoriasis. They can quickly reduce inflammation, itching, and the production of excess skin cells. \n\n3. Vitamin D analogues: Vitamin D based treatments can slow down the rate of skin cell growth and alleviate symptoms of psoriasis. These may be used in combination with topical corticosteroids or alone.\n\n4. Light therapy (phototherapy): Light therapy involves exposing the skin to controlled amounts of natural or artificial light. It seems to be effective for psoriasis by slowing the growth of skin cells. \n\nPlease remember, all methods should be used under the direction of your doctor or dermatologist to ensure safety. Most treatments will not cure psoriasis entirely but will reduce or eliminate symptoms for certain periods and a combination often works better than one treatment alone. \n\nFor itching, you can use an over-the-counter antihistamine",
    "352": "Herpes is a diagnosis that can sometimes be determined visually by a trained healthcare provider due to its characteristic appearance of clustered blisters or ulcers. However, it's not uncommon for other conditions to be mistaken as herpes such as ingrown hairs, folliculitis, a yeast infection, or even certain types of dermatitis. The doctor probably judged based on their clinical expertise, but it's very important to wait for your culture results to confirm. \n\nRegarding herbal or natural remedies, while they may help support immune function or skin health, the most effective treatment for herpes outbreaks is antiviral medication, which can only be provided by a healthcare provider. \n\nTopical creams containing lemon balm or tea tree oil have been suggested due to their anti-viral properties, and supplements like lysine, vitamin C, and zinc can support immune function. However, these are not treatments for herpes and they don't substitute antiviral medication. If you're considering alternative or supplementary treatments, make sure to discuss them with your healthcare provider first to ensure they're safe and won't interfere with your prescribed treatment. \n\nMost importantly, remember to take care of your general health with good nutrition, regular exercise, adequate sleep and stress management -- all these are essential in helping your body resist and fight infections.",
    "353": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing pain and discomfort. It's normal for your periods to be heavier and more painful with a copper coil (IUD), however, missing periods isn’t as common. It could be that your body is still adjusting to the IUD, or it could be due to other factors like stress, weight changes, or more rarely a hormonal imbalance. \n\nThe tenderness in your abdomen and cramping could be related to the IUD or could suggest an infection or possible dislocation of the IUD. While it's not an emergency, it should be checked. \n\nIt's good you've taken a pregnancy test already. Oral pregnancy tests can be quite reliable, but it's not completely impossible for them to give a false-negative result, so it might be beneficial to test again in a week or so. \n\nPlease make a visit to your healthcare provider or gynecologist for a physical exam and possibly an ultrasound to check the placement of the IUD, make sure there's no infection, and hopefully get to the bottom of why you're missing your periods. \n\nI hope this helps and that you feel better soon!

    "354": "I'm sorry to hear about your child's ongoing cough. A \"barking\" cough in children is often associated with a condition called croup, which is an inflammation of the upper airways (the trachea and larynx). Croup is generally caused by viruses and is most common in children aged 6 months to 3 years but it can occasionally affect older children. In some cases, it can become a recurring problem. \n\nIf his cough is more chronic and present for a long period of time, it could indeed be a symptom of asthma, as your doctors have suggested. \n\nI recommend you to follow up again with his pediatrician for evaluation, as sometimes additional testing or changes in treatment are needed to get symptoms under control. For asthma, this generally includes a long-term controller medication (like an inhaled steroid, which is likely what the 'Aspelone' is) and a \"rescue\" medicine to be used for more severe or sudden symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure your home is free of common asthma triggers, such as cigarette smoke, dust mites, and pet dander.

The presence of a lesion in the liver of that size raises concerns about liver cancer, particularly as the doctor has already raised this suspicion. However, definitive diagnosis is usually made based on a biopsy (a small sample of the lesion is taken and examined under a microscope).  The prognosis and treatment will heavily depend on the extent of disease and if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, the patient's overall health status and liver function. Treatment options usually include surgical resection (removing the tumor), liver transplant (if feasible), chemotherapy, and/or targeted therapy. Should the diagnosis be confirmed, I highly recommend getting in touch with a medical oncologist who specializes in hepatocellular carcinoma for treatment options.",

The most common causes are enlarged lymph nodes, parotid gland disorders, dental infections or less commonly, tumoral masses. Your dentures, if not fitting well or if they are causing irritation, might lead to an infection or inflammation that could subsequently cause the lymph nodes in that area to swell. Other possibilities could include issues such as salivary gland stones or even cysts.

The discomfort you're feeling under your left rib cage could potentially be related to gas or bloating, which is a common symptom of IBS. Previously, muscles in your bowel wall might have been spasmed causing the discomfort. Now as the bowel movements have stabilized, the spasms might have relieved, but the chronic irritation might be still there. \n\nHowever, it would be a good idea to follow up with your gastroenterologist and inform him about this persistent symptom, especially if the irritation continues or if you start to notice other symptoms. It might be beneficial to have an ultrasound done to rule out any structural issues as well.\n\nTry to continue avoiding stress, as it can exacerbate the symptoms of IBS. Physical activity and a balanced diet can also help manage IBS.\n\nRemember that while IBS can be a chronic condition, it doesn't lead to serious diseases like cancer. With the appropriate management strategy, the symptoms of IBS can be successfully controlled. \n\nI hope this information provides some reassurance, however; consult your primary healthcare provider for more personalized advice. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have more questions.",
    "358": "Hello, the injuries you describe certainly need professional medical attention. With the swelling, pain, and heat, there could be a significant damage to the soft tissue, or even a potential fracture which could explain the inability for the swelling to go down. An X-ray would be very useful in ruling out any fractures. Moreover, the controlled inflammation from applying ice and elevating your leg should help decrease the swelling, but given your symptoms, I strongly advise you to be evaluated by a professional. Non-weight bearing until you are evaluated would be advised. A tetanus shot might also be needed, and possible antibiotic prophylaxis considering this was an open wound. Please get evaluated as soon as possible.",
    "359": "Hello. Based on the symptoms you've shared, it's possible you may be experiencing effects of stress or a viral illness, as these symptoms are very general and can be associated with a variety of conditions. However, any chest pain that is \"stabbing\" and symptoms that persist should be evaluated in person by a healthcare professional to rule out a more serious condition such as cardiac disease. Headaches that come and go can be attributed to many things like dehydration, tension, or even eye strain. Your ongoing muscle fatigue could be due to a myriad of reasons, from lack of proper nutrition and vitamin deficiencies to fibromyalgia. \n\nIt is strongly recommended that you see a healthcare provider as soon as possible to discuss these symptoms. They may want to perform blood tests as well, and possibly an EKG or other diagnostic cardiac evaluation to ensure there are no serious underlying issues. It's important to listen to your body and seek care when symptoms persist.",
    "360": "Hi, thanks for reaching out. \n\nIn the case of PCOS, hormone fluctuation is quite common, which may be why you've seen an increase in testosterone level. Diane 35, which contains cyproterone, is an anti-androgen medicine that helps to balance hormone levels in your body. However, it does not work immediately and it may take several months to see a significant decrease in testosterone levels. \n\nAs for the medication Pregnyl, it is an hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin), which is commonly used to trigger ovulation after other fertility drugs have been used to stimulate follicle development. I do not see any direct correlation between the use of Pregnyl and a rise in your testosterone levels.\n\nYou should discuss your hormone status and whether or not you need to be concerned about the increase in testosterone levels with your physician once they're back. They can give you a better understanding based on your complete health status.",
    "361": "It's normal to experience some discomfort for a few days after a tooth extraction. However, persistent pain can indicate a complication such as dry socket or infection.\n\nA white socket might indicate a normal healing process (granulation tissue forming) or something of concern (like a dry socket). A dry socket occurs when the blood clot at the site of the tooth extraction has been dislodged or has dissolved before the wound has healed. It's characterized by a throbbing pain that can radiate to your ear or neck, and the socket might appear empty.\n\nGiven the intensity of your pain and the fact that over-the-counter pain relievers are failing to control it, I advise you to contact your dentist right away to check the extraction site and determine if you have developed a dry socket or an infection. If present, treatment can then accordingly be initiated. \n\nIt's important to keep an eye out for other signs of infection such as swelling, redness, fever, or purulent discharge as well. \n\nIt would be best to not delay this, as if left untreated, these conditions could lead to further complications. You may need stronger pain medications, possibly in addition to antibiotics, or other procedures to help with the healing process.",
    "362": "Hello, the symptoms you described like missed period, nausea, tender breasts, and cramps could be signs of pregnancy. However, the \"dettol test\" you're referring to is not a medically recognized or reliable method of detecting pregnancy. I would highly recommend you use a home pregnancy test, as they are relatively cheap and very accurate if used properly. The best time to take a pregnancy test is one week after your missed period for the most accurate result. If the result is negative, I would advise you to consult with a healthcare provider for further evaluation. Other conditions such as hormonal imbalances or stress could also cause missed periods. Best Regards.",
    "363": "Hello, thank you for reaching out. If you're trying to conceive for 2 years without success, it's reasonable to seek medical help. Since your thyroid and uterus are normal and hormonal levels are currently balanced, that's good news. Your doctor suggesting a follicular scan is to assess your ovarian reserves and to monitor the health and growth of the follicles (that mature into eggs) as well as targeting the timing of ovulation, which is crucial in conception. So, this is a good step forward. Keep in mind that factors such as stress, diet, or your partner's sperm health can also affect fertility. Ensure to maintain a healthy lifestyle and discuss any concerns with your doctor. If your follicular scan reveals any issues, treatment options are available. Remember, it often takes time and patience. Good luck and I hope you get positive news soon!",
    "364": "Hello RJ,\n\nWhat you're describing in your friend is certainly troubling. Effexor, or Venlafaxine, is an antidepressant medication that can indeed interact unfavorably with alcohol, potentially exacerbating its effects. Moreover, this combination can increase the risk of dangerous side effects, such as suicidal thinking, impaired coordination, and heightened depression and anxiety. That being said, symptoms this severe aren't typical.\n\nGiven his heavy drinking and the severity of his reaction, it's important to have him evaluated emergently. His symptoms could potentially be due to alcohol withdrawal or an alcohol-related condition called delirium tremens, which can also cause confusion, hallucinations, and severe mood changes.\n\nThe plan you and his sons have is certainly reasonable. I would strongly recommend taking him to the emergency room when he is experiencing these symptoms. Long term, he will likely benefit from specialized addiction counseling, a thorough psychiatric evaluation, and possibly a change in his medication regimen. Please encourage him to avoid alcohol altogether until he is evaluated by a healthcare provider. His situation sounds serious and warrants immediate attention. \n\nYou are doing a great job supporting your friend through these tough times. Please take him to get help as soon as possible.\n\nTake care and best of luck,\nChat Doctor.",
    "365": "Hello, it's understandable that you're feeling concerned about these ongoing symptoms. Chronic pain near the shoulder blade could be due to a multitude of reasons including musculoskeletal issues, nerve impingement or even stress and anxiety. However, lasting heaviness in the chest area, especially if it's near the heart, should not be ignored, particularly if you are experiencing episodes of accelerated heart rate. \n\nIt's important to rule out heart diseases, despite the results of previous tests you might have done. Conditions like angina (chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscles) can manifest as pain in the left shoulder and chest area, as well as a heavy feeling in the chest. Some forms of arrhythmia (heart rhythm problems) can cause bouts of tachycardia (fast heart rate). \n\nIt's also important to consider that you mentioned having anxiety. Anxiety disorders can mimic symptoms of heart disease, such as chest pain and palpitations, but this should only be considered once all potential heart conditions have been ruled out. \n\nIn any case, I strongly advise you to consult your doctor again for further assessments. You might need further cardiac workup, such as a stress test, echocardiogram, or Holter monitor. Don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional to address your anxiety issues if they seem to be worsening or strongly influencing your physical symptoms.",
    "366": "Yes, you should definitely seek immediate medical attention for your son. A week without a bowel movement is concerning, especially with the presence of stomach pain. It's possible that he may be severely constipated and could need medical intervention to relieve it. A condition called encopresis could also be involved, which is when a child resists having bowel movements, causing stool to collect in the colon and rectum and leading to leakage. Don't try to deal with this situation at home, especially as he is in pain. A healthcare professional needs to assess him.",
    "367": "As per your symptoms, you are likely suffering from iron deficiency anemia. Low iron in the body can cause intense cravings for eating ice, as well as feelings of exhaustion. In this case, I would recommend you to schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor or a hematologist. They can confirm the diagnosis with a blood test, then suggest strategies for improving your diet or prescribe iron supplements. Additionally, it can also be important to investigate if there is a specific reason why you're having iron deficiency, such as a problem with absorption in your gut, or due to blood loss.",
    "368": "Hello and welcome. Your high AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) levels could be due to a number of reasons. While this enzyme is present in liver cells, it's also found in muscles and other tissues. High levels could indicate ongoing damage or disease, such as liver disease, heart conditions, or muscle disorders. If you're having stomach issues as well, it could indicate something like gastritis or gallstones. It can also increase due to consumption of alcohol. However, to find the root cause, more information and further tests are needed. It's best to follow up with a healthcare provider to figure out how best to proceed.",
    "369": "I'm sorry to hear about your father. Neurobion is a multivitamin supplement that's often used to help improve nerve function. In the context of a cerebrovascular accident (CVA or stroke), Neurobion can certainly be beneficial as part of a broader picture of treatments aimed at improving nerve function and overall brain health, but it's not specifically a treatment for stroke. Stroke treatment usually involves blood thinners and drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as lifestyle changes and, in some cases, surgery. It's important your father continues to see a neurologist or a stroke specialist for his condition.",
    "370": "I'm sorry to hear about your discomfort and your struggles with trying to conceive. This kind of burning sensation in the area where your ovary is located could be due to ovulation, but it also could be associated with a cyst, as you suggested. PCOS typically involves the formation of multiple small cysts on the ovaries, which usually don't cause pain unless they rupture or cause the ovary to twist. In your case, I would strongly recommend getting it checked by your healthcare provider, preferably through an ultrasound to evaluate your symptoms and rule out potential complications. Even though you are using natural remedies now, it is important to maintain regular follow-ups with your treating doctor. Please note, the effective treatment of PCOS often involves a multifaceted approach that includes lifestyle changes, and sometimes medication to help regulate your cycle. Keep your spirit high and be patient; your efforts are valuable and there are many women who have successfully managed PCOS and conceived.",
    "371": "Hello. I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way. Palpitations and numbness could be due to a number of different things, so it's important to get a thorough check-up in order to narrow down the cause. \n\nFor the mitral valve prolapse, while it can cause palpitations, it usually doesn't cause numbness in the limbs. Therefore, other possibilities such as sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, anxiety, and certain medications should be investigated.\n\nFor the palpitations, beta blockers may be added or adjusted to help regulate the heart rhythm. I suggest getting an event monitor (a heart monitor you wear for several weeks) to better assess your heart's rhythm overnight and during the palpitations.\n\nThe numbness in the arms and fingers is generally suggestive of a nerve issue (neuropathy), but could also be vascular. You should check with a neurologist for a detailed evaluation, which may include nerve conduction studies. \n\nPlease make sure to visit your primary care physician to discuss this plan and possibly get a referral to a cardiologist and a neurologist. Your doctors can collaborate to provide the best care for you.\n\nI hope this helps. Get well soon!",
    "372": "It sounds like you may have had an abscess or gum infection, especially considering your previous dental history in that area. In some cases, these types of infections can drain and reduce in size on their own, which would explain why the blister seems like it has gone. However, the soreness in the area suggests there may still be some lingering inflammation or infection. Gum diseases that need professional treatment may include anything from gum inflammation to something serious like abscess. \n\nYou should book an appointment with your dentist for a proper examination. In the meantime, maintain good oral hygiene and do warm saline rinses 3-4 times a day. These issues can often reemerge if the underlying cause is not addressed, so it's important you speak with a professional about this. Don't take any medication without consulting your dentist.",
    "373": "Hello, it seems like being treated with Concor 5 lowered your blood pressure, but not to the desired level, which is below 130/80 if you have any other risk factors like diabetes or chronic kidney disease, or below 140/90 if you do not have these conditions. Your doctor has prescribed AmlodipresAT, which is a combination of two medications: amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, and atenolol, a beta blocker. Both of these medications work to lower your blood pressure. Continue to check your blood pressure regularly. Additionally, lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol can also help manage your blood pressure. Be sure to give your medication some time to work, and consult with your doctor if you have any side effects or if your blood pressure does not decrease as expected.",
    "374": "Hello, I understand your concern and anxiety about the situation. An enlarged uterus is generally not a cause of infertility, unless it is caused by conditions like fibroids, adenomyosis or any other pathology. If your doctor has said that your reports are normal, it suggests that the size might be within normal limits for you. Remember, there is a range of normal sizes for the uterus and ovaries. \n\nThe medication Letrozole that you have been prescribed is a type of fertility drug which is used to stimulate the ovaries to produce more eggs, enhancing the chances of conception. \n\nTypically, even in a perfectly healthy couple, the per-cycle chance of a successful pregnancy is about 20-25%. However, please follow up with your doctor as advised. \n\nIn addition to this, make sure you are having regular, unprotected intercourse throughout your menstrual cycle, not just around your \"ovulation days\", as ovulation can sometimes occur earlier or later than expected. \n\nAlso maintain a healthy lifestyle - a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoid smoking or alcohol if applicable. These factors can enhance fertility. \n\nRemember, stress and anxiety can affect fertility as well. Regular relaxation and stress-management techniques like yoga and meditation can be beneficial. \n\nBest of luck in your journey to conception.",
    "375": "Hello. From the sounds of it, the symptoms you experienced could have resulted from a number of different conditions. The swelling in your legs and the changes in your tongue color could point towards circulation issues. The lesions on the tongue might be indicative of an inflammation or minor infection, possibly due to lowered immunity from stress or other conditions. Your \"hot/cold/chills\" could also be related to a minor infection or inflammation. The disc-related back pain could be exacerbated by sitting or standing for extended periods, like during your long drive. \nHowever, without being able to conduct an examination and run some tests, it's difficult to provide a solid diagnosis. If these symptoms appear again, make sure to reach out to a healthcare practitioner right away. Also, remember to maintain a healthy lifestyle to support your immune system and overall physical condition.",
    "376": "Hello Mrs. Holley, \n\nIt appears as if you are experiencing a broad range of symptoms, many of which can be associated with a variety of different conditions. It's good to hear that your liver, pancreas, and gallbladder have been checked and that they are normal. However, considering the nature of your symptoms, it would be a good idea to get evaluated for conditions that can cause dizziness, fainting, fatigue, and tingling, such as anemia, vertigo, irregular heart rhythms, or neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis. You may also want to check your hydration levels, as dehydration can cause light-headedness, headaches, and malaise.\n\nGiven the severity of your symptoms, especially given the fainting episode and continued malaise, I would strongly recommend scheduling an appointment with your physician as soon as possible. If you're unable to get in for an appointment promptly and your symptoms persist or worsen, a trip to the emergency room may be necessary to prevent any further incidents. Meanwhile, try to stay hydrated, eat small frequent healthy meals, and rest as much as you can.\n\nThis advice is based on the symptoms you have reported and is intended to guide you in discussions with your doctor, not replace a physical examination. Get medical help right away if your condition worsens.",
    "377": "It sounds like you've been dealing with some complex and difficult feelings. I can understand why you might be looking for help to navigate them. Individual therapy could be a beneficial step for you. Look for a licensed clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist who specializes in psychodynamic therapy, which is a form of depth psychology, the primary focus is to reveal the unconscious content of a client's psyche in an effort to alleviate psychic tension.\n\nIn a therapy setting, you could explore your feelings of insecurity, inadequate maturity, and low self-esteem in a safe and structured environment. Remember, it's never too late to work on personal growth and development. \n\nYou may also want to consider group therapy, in which people experiencing similar problems help each other under the guidance of a professional. This could offer you a whole new insight into your issues and help you develop new strategies for your daily life. \n\nFinally, it's crucial that you involve your family in your healing process, as it seems like your concerns are affecting your relationships with them as well. Family therapy could be another beneficial option.\n\nPlease reach out to your primary care physician for recommendations on next steps and potential referrals to mental health professionals.",
    "378": "Hi, I'm sorry to hear you're feeling unwell. Persistent cough with green, sticky sputum could be indicative of a lower respiratory tract infection like bronchitis or pneumonia. The effectiveness of antibiotics depends on the specific bacteria causing the infection. Amoxicillin and doxycycline are both broad-spectrum antibiotics that are often used to treat these types of infections.\n\nHowever, the continuous production of green sputum may indicate that the infection is not yet under control. You should return to your healthcare provider for further evaluation and to discuss the need for alternate or additional treatment, such as different antibiotics or medications to help manage your symptoms, chest physiotherapy, or a referral to a respiratory specialist.\n\nIf you have any other symptoms like high fever, chest pain, or increasing difficulty breathing, you should seek immediate medical attention. Always remember to finish the full course of your antibiotics, even if you're feeling better, to ensure the infection is completely eradicated and to help prevent antibiotic resistance.",
    "379": "Hello, thanks for contacting Chat Doctor. The hard bumps you're describing in your groin could possibly be lymph nodes, which may enlarge due to infections or inflammations in lower limbs or genital area. Another possibility is inguinal hernias, where a part of the intestine bulges through a weak area in the abdominal muscles, often feeling like a round lump. It's important to get this examined by a healthcare professional, as you mention that it's getting bigger. Until you're able to see a doctor, I'd advise you to monitor the lump(s) and take note of any pain, changes in size, or any other symptoms you may experience, like fever or weight loss. This information will be useful to your doctor. Please do not delay in getting this checked out. ",
    "380": "Hello, thanks for your query. \n\nExcessive hair shedding could be due to multiple reasons, but seeing as you're in your mid to late 40's, the cause could be due to changes in hormone levels that come with aging, both for men and women. \n\nStress can also play a key role in hair loss. Other causes that need to be considered include nutrient deficiencies, certain medications, hypothyroidism, chemotherapy, and more specific hair diseases.\n\nAssuming there is no other major medical issue and this is due to aging, it may be helpful to seek out more specific treatments like minoxidil (Rogaine) and/or talking with a dermatologist who can, if necessary, prescribe other medications to help enhance hair growth. \n\nTaking extra care of your hair, for example, not using harsh chemicals, blow drying/ straightening less, and maintaining a healthy diet with ample protein and iron, may also be useful for you.\n\nIt is also important to note that everyone loses hair every day, up to 150 strands a day. Only when you notice considerably more strands falling, or bald patches, should you be concerned. \n\nRemember that these suggestions are quite general, and it is advisable to see a healthcare provider who can give you more specific guidance.",

More importantly, they can be used in patients who have failed interferon-based treatment. The medications are usually given for 12-24 weeks and the specific regimen depends upon the genotype of the virus, presence of liver cirrhosis, and prior treatment history.

In the meantime, continue with your current regimen and make sure you bring up these persistent symptoms with your spinal doctor at your next meeting. They might want to consider additional treatment options such as further physical therapy, targeted exercises, potential changes in medication, or even surgical interventions in severe cases.

    "383": "I'm sorry your son is not feeling well. From what you've described, it does sound like he's picked up a viral infection or a cold which can exacerbate asthma symptoms. In regards to the eye discharge and redness, that might be a sign of a separate eye infection (conjunctivitis) which also could be a result from the same viral infection.\n\nIn terms of medications:\n1. It's safe to continue using his asthma medications, including Asthavent, especially during illness as suggested by your pediatrician. Stick to the recommended schedule or as often as prescribed to manage his asthma symptoms.\n2. Adco-Tussi linctus syrup and Mucospect may help relieve his cough, but always follow the recommended dose from the doctor or pharmacist, and ensure that it doesn't contain any ingredients he's allergic to.\n3.

Bronchiolitis is often caused by a viral infection, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and it primarily affects children under the age of 2. The symptoms can indeed last quite a few weeks, even after the virus itself is gone. The recurrent coughing may be a sign that his airways are still irritated and recovering from the infection. However, it could also indicate an additional problem, such as allergies or asthma. Also, there is a chance that he contracted a new respiratory viral or bacterial infection after being discharged from the hospital. \n\nRegarding the gas, do you mean he has excess gas in his stomach or flatulence? This may be due to a change in diet, swallowing of air during crying or feeding, or even due to some medications. \n\nI would advise to continue the physiotherapy as it helps to clear the chest and improve his respiratory function. \n\nAs with any ongoing or recurrent health issue, I recommend seeing his pediatrician for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.

Given the complexity of her symptoms, it is necessary for her to have a multidisciplinary team of physicians evaluate her. \n\nFirstly, she should see a urologist. The fact that bacteria has been found in the urine, along with the kidney area pain may indicate kidney stones or another problem in urinary tract. If the exact bacteria type has not been identified yet, consider asking for a urine culture and sensitivity test, it will not only identify the bacteria but will also provide information on which antibiotic works best.\n\nNext, she might benefit from seeing a gastroenterologist. The gastric issues you mention (burning, bloating, and difficulty eating that has persisted for a year) could be due to gastroparesis, gastritis, GERD or potentially an ulcer. A gastric endoscopy might be useful.\n\nFor her vaginal pain and blood clots, it would be beneficial to visit a gynecologist. This specialist can check for pelvic inflammatory disease, any post-surgical anomalies given her history of hysterectomy, or other conditions that could be causing these symptoms. \n\nPain management may also be an area to look into since she's already seeing multiple specialists. It's really crucial that she consults with a pain management specialist who can help manage her discomfort while the root cause is being identified.\n\nPlease make sure that all the doctors she sees are in communication with each other to coordinate her care.

    "386": "Hi, Montair LC Kid tablet contains Montelukast and Levocetirizine. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist which works by blocking the action of leukotriene, a chemical messenger. This reduces inflammation in the airways to prevent asthma and relieve symptoms of allergies. Levocetirizine is an antihistaminic medication. It blocks the action of certain chemical messengers responsible for inflammation, congestion, itching, and other allergic reactions. \n\nThe medications you're currently giving are relievers but Montair LC Kid would work to prevent the episodes. It is generally taken for a long duration and should be given at bedtime.\n\nSide effects include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, skin rash, flu-like symptoms, and fatigue. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor promptly. \n\nIn terms of duration, this would be something to discuss with your pediatrician as it can vary from person to person. Some children need to take it for years, whereas others need it only during certain times of the year when their triggers are more present.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that while these medicines help control the symptoms of asthma, they don't cure the condition. Alongside medication, identifying and avoiding triggers, regular exercise, a healthy diet, and minimizing exposure to air pollution can also help manage your son's symptoms. \n\nAlways consult your physician or paediatrician before starting any new medication.",

This can cause pain, swelling and discoloration, which can last for several weeks. However, if you're still experiencing difficulty moving your arm after 6 months, I strongly recommend you see a doctor to have it examined. They may order imaging studies, such as an ultrasound or MRI, to evaluate the structures in your arm and to check for any possible long-term damage. It's possible that the trauma of the initial injury and subsequent hematoma may have caused some level of nerve irritation or muscle damage, which is now being exacerbated by physical activity.

It appears that a lot of the standard tests and treatments have been tried without much relief. One thought is that you could be experiencing a functional disorder, such as functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS). This is a condition in which there is abdominal pain but no structural defect is found upon clinical examination, endoscopy or imaging. It can be associated with stress, anxiety, and often starts after a stressful or traumatic event.\n\nManaging FAPS can involve various non-pharmaceutical treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy, behavior modification (relaxation and biofeedback), and physical activity, like you mentioned that you swim daily, which is good. In terms of medications, studies have shown that medications such as certain types of antidepressants can be beneficial for some people.\n\nKeep in mind that it is also important to focus on your mental well being. Psychological factors and stress can play a big role in these functional disorders. Psychotherapy and techniques for stress management can help you to cope with the chronic pain.\n\nLastly, I want to stress the importance of working closely with your primary care provider or a gastroenterologist who can really get to know your situation and monitor your progress.

Some people may also have a reaction when they combine alcohol with certain foods. \n\nWhen your body perceives a substance as harmful, your immune system can react and release histamine, which can cause symptoms like redness, itching, and blotches. \n\nAlthough your symptoms seem to resolve by morning, repeated exposure can increase the severity of your reactions over time, and there's always the risk of a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.\n\nIf you're aware that you have a gluten allergy, it's crucial to avoid gluten in both food and drink. Some types of alcohol, including certain beers and vodkas, can contain gluten. Always drink alcohol in moderation and try to determine if specific beverages cause this reaction and avoid them.\n\nIn the meantime, to help with the redness and itchiness, you can take over-the-counter antihistamines, but they can cause drowsiness. Applying a cool compress might also help.\n\nIt would also be beneficial to schedule an appointment with an allergist.

Now with regards to your tuberculosis, treatment of TB generally includes a regimen of multiple drugs taken for a lengthy period of time (generally 6 to 12 months). Your fertility should not be affected once you complete your course of treatment, particularly if the disease hasn't spread to your reproductive organs. Non-Tuberculosis Mycobacterium (NTM) is generally not thought to be transmitted person-to-person, so your partner is not likely to get infected. \n\nHowever, I strongly recommend that you discuss these concerns with your doctor. It's vital that you understand the nature of your condition, its implications for your future health, and what precautions you may need to take to prevent infecting others. It's also important to know that feeling stressed out is normal when dealing with a chronic illness like TB. You might find it helpful to talk to a mental health professional about your concerns, or perhaps join a support group for people with TB. Best of luck to you.",
    "393": "Hi, Marijuana use is shown in some studies to affect sperm quality. While it won't be directly tested or seen on a sperm analysis, it can affect the number, shape, and motility of the sperm which are factors that will be observed in the sperm analysis test.\n\nIf you are planning on having a baby, it would be best for you to stop using marijuana as it can affect fertility. Other factors that can improve your sperm quality include:\n- Maintaining a healthy weight\n- Eating a healthy diet with plenty of lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables\n- Regular exercise\n- Taking a multivitamin \n- Avoiding substance abuse including alcohol and tobacco \n- Limiting exposure to environmental toxins and radiation\n- Avoiding excessive heat exposure to the testicles (avoid tight pants, take cool showers etc.)\n \nBe sure to make these lifestyle changes, especially stopping the marijuana use prior to your sperm test. Your sperm regenerate approximately every 74 days, so incorporating these changes now will have a positive effect on your sperm health in about two to three months. Good luck!",
    "394": "Congratulations on making the decision to quit smoking. This is one of the most important steps you can take to improve your health. The symptoms you're experiencing are concerning, especially the heart rhythm issues, high blood pressure, and fatigue. While nicotine withdrawal can cause some symptoms, it's not usually responsible for these specific signs, at least not three months after quitting.\n\nYour symptoms could be due to a heart condition like hypertension (high blood pressure) or arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). Both conditions could potentially be life-threatening if left untreated. Smoking can cause a buildup of plaque in your arteries, which can lead to heart disease. Also, long-term smoking can cause damage to your lungs which could lead to shortness of breath and fatigue.\n\nI would advise you to consult with your healthcare provider as soon as possible. You may need a physical examination, EKG (electrocardiogram), blood tests, and possibly other tests to determine exactly what's happening.\n\nIn the meantime, try to limit your salt intake and maintain a balanced diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Regular moderate-intensity exercise can also be beneficial for heart health, but please consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new exercise regime.",
    "395": "Hello, the lump you're feeling is likely a hematoma, which is a collection of blood caused by the injury. The blood is gradually being absorbed by the body but this can take some time, especially for larger hematomas. Usually, this does not required to be drained. However, if the lump remains for another month or so, gets bigger, changes shape, or becomes painful, then you should have it checked out by a healthcare professional. In the meantime, warm compresses can help to speed up the absorption process. Also, continue with your regular exercise regime as long as it doesn't cause any discomfort. Nonetheless, it's always a good idea to get any persistent lump checked out to rule out any other potential problems. Please discuss this with your doctor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",
    "396": "Hello. I understand your concern. While it's theoretically possible to become pregnant from dried semen on a hand, the chances are extremely low. The reason for this is that sperm do not live long outside the body. They require the right conditions in terms of moisture and temperature to survive, and once these conditions are not met, they dry up and die rapidly. \n\nAs for the spotting you're experiencing, it's quite normal, especially since you mentioned that you lost your virginity. This could be a result of the sex itself, especially if it was your first time and there was any tearing of the hymen or other irritation that occurred. However, if the bleeding is heavy or you are in pain, you should seek medical attention.\n\nKeep in mind it's always a good idea to practice safe sex and use contraception if you want to avoid pregnancy. Your local health clinic, GP, or a gynecologist can provide advice on the best type of contraception for you. And in future if you ever feel worried or unsure after having sex, don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional. They are there to help and provide advice.",
    "397": "I understand your frustration and the emotional toll this can take on you. Regarding PCOS and thyroid issues, if your levels are managed well with medication, these conditions should not prevent you from becoming pregnant. In relation to your husband's sperm count, while 60% abnormal sperm can lower your chances of natural conception, IUI or IVF can greatly improve these odds. It's also important to note that there is no guaranteed way to ensure pregnancy on the first round of IUI. \n\nIn the meantime, focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle - eat well, exercise regularly, and maintain a healthy weight. Also, consider seeing a counselor or therapist to help manage the stress and emotional load you are carrying. Your mental health is as important as your physical health during this process.\n\nRemember, getting pregnant can take time, even without health issues. It's important to keep positive, stay focused, and stick with your treatment plan. Always communicate fully with your doctor, and don't hesitate to get a second opinion if you're not satisfied with the care you're receiving.",
    "398": "Hello, it's good that you've already seen your doctor about this. Lumps under the armpit can be caused by several things such as infection, cyst, or lymph node enlargement. You mentioned that the lump on the left has gone smaller which indicates it might be a benign condition, perhaps due to infection or inflammation. The new lump on the right side that is painful might also be due to similar reasons. \n\nHowever, I would recommend you to go back to your doctor for assessment of this new lump, especially as it is causing pain. This is important to rule out any serious conditions and for appropriate treatment if it is due to infection or inflammation. You can also take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs for relief from pain until you see your doctor. Good hygiene is also essential. Try to avoid shaving or using deodorant until seen by your doctor.\n\nRemember, it's important to consistently monitor any changes to your health and seek immediate medical attention if you notice any change or worsen symptoms.",
    "399": "I'm sorry to hear about your discomfort. Even though you did not initially have chest symptoms, sometimes pain can manifest a few days after an injury. The pain could be from bruising or from other soft tissue injury caused by trauma to the chest. Also, if you're experiencing any difficulty in breathing, this could be a more serious complication such as a punctured lung. I recommend that you see your doctor as soon as possible to rule out any serious conditions. In the meantime, be sure to rest and avoid any activities that may exacerbate your pain. It's always best to seek medical attention when new symptoms occur after an injury.",
    "400": "Hello. I understand that trying to conceive for 6 months without success can be frustrating. However, it's essential to know that in the general population, the chance of getting pregnant in just one cycle is only about 20-25%. Most couples who are trying to conceive do get pregnant within a year. \n\nHowever, several factors can affect fertility. These can include age, general health, reproductive health, timing and frequency of sexual intercourse, and many others. You're already doing well by taking folic acid to prepare your body for pregnancy. \n\nIf associated with regular periods, it indicates regular ovulation which is a good sign for fertility. You could enhance your chances by monitoring ovulation and timing sexual intercourse accordingly - fertile days are typically a few days before and after ovulation.\n\nHowever, if you continue to have difficulty conceiving, you may wish to consult a fertility specialist or gynecologist for a thorough check-up. They may recommend additional tests for you and your partner to check for any potential issues. These tests can include hormonal profile, an ultrasound to screen for ovarian and uterine health, checking semen analysis, etc.\n\nIt's also essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle - balanced diet, regular physical\nactivity, adequate sleep; as well as avoiding excess caffeine, smoking, and alcohol, as these factors can also impact your fertility.\n\nRemember that it's normal for it to take a while to become pregnant. Try not to stress over the situation, as stress can also impact fertility",
    "401": "As a doctor, I highly recommend discussing this with your primary care physician or specialist before making this decision. Blood transfusions aren't usually recommended unless the hemoglobin is 7 or below, or if the patient is symptomatic and his/her activities of daily living are affected. It seems you do have symptoms (tiredness), but your hemoglobin is at 9 which is not critically low. It's also important to remember that blood transfusions carry risks, such as allergic reactions, infections, or transfusion reactions. Your doctor most likely suggested the natural route of regaining your hemoglobin (through iron-rich diet and supplementary iron) because it's the healthier, safer, and more natural process. However, your feelings of fatigue and wish for a quicker recovery are understandable. I suggest expressing these concerns with your doctor. They know more about your situation and can guide you adequately.",
    "402": "Hello! It could very well be a fungal infection, but without examining you or at least seeing pictures, I can't be sure. Conditions like hormonal changes after childbirth, tinea versicolor (a type of fungal infection), or other dermatological conditions could cause this. As you mentioned that these spots are spreading and getting darker, I would highly recommend that you get this assessed by a local healthcare provider or dermatologist as soon as possible. They can do tests like skin scrapings to diagnose a fungal infection if it's present. Meanwhile, try to keep the skin clean and dry, and avoid scratching to prevent secondary infection. If you could provide pictures, that would also be helpful.",
    "403": "I'm sorry to hear that your mother is having such difficulties. Her weight loss could be due to her diabetes not being well controlled, or due to another underlying condition. Her inability to walk may be due both to her arthritis and to weakness caused by her weight loss. I would strongly suggest that you consult with her doctor or another medical professional about these issues as soon as possible.\nAs for home remedies, while they should not replace professional medical advice, here are some options to consider:\n1. Physiotherapy: Gentle exercises can help maintain joint flexibility. Water exercises are particularly good because they allow movement with less weight on the joints.\n2. Warm Compresses: Applying a warm compress or a heating pad to the painful joints may help relieve pain.\n3. Balanced Diet: Ensure her diet is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins D and C, all of which are beneficial for joint and overall health. A dietician can provide personalized advice.\n4. Gentle Massage: Lightly massaging the painful joints with warm oil can improve blood circulation and reduce pain and stiffness. \n\nPlease consult with a health care provider before starting any new regimen or treatment.

    "404": "Hello Preston,\n\nTyphoid is caused by the bacteria called Salmonella Typhi which is often found in contaminated food and water. While it's not specifically about mangoes, any food or fruit that has been in contact with contaminated water or handled by someone with typhoid could potentially be a source of infection. The important thing is to ensure that all your food is cooked properly and washed with safe, treated water. \n\nFor someone getting recurring episodes like you described, it would be pertinent to get a stool culture test done to see if you are a chronic carrier of the bacteria. Chronic carriers can harbor the bacteria in their body for a long time without showing symptoms but can still spread the infection. \n\nSince you're in Mexico, it would be a good idea to drink only bottled or treated water, avoid raw food which isn't peeled or cooked, and maintain good hand hygiene. You may also consider getting vaccinated against typhoid if you haven't done so already.\n\nHowever, for the immediate concern, I would recommend you to consult with a local doctor who can evaluate your repeated episodes and decide an effective course of action.\n\nTake care,\nDr. Chat",
    "405": "I'm really sorry to hear you're experiencing this. An infected, broken tooth can indeed cause severe pain and complications like swollen lymph nodes. Your symptoms sound serious and need immediate attention. Given your financial situation, you may want to seek help from a free or low-cost dental clinic in your area, or a dental school where students treat patients under the supervision of experienced dentists. \n\nIn the meantime, please continue taking Penicillin if it has been prescribed by a healthcare provider. You can also use over-the-counter pain relievers, rinse your mouth with warm salt water, and avoid foods that are extremely hot, cold, sweet, or acidic, as they can exacerbate the pain. Please remember these measures are temporary and see a dentist as soon as possible to avoid complications. It sounds like your wisdom tooth needs to be extracted. \n\nI must stress that ignoring this issue not only leads to increased pain and discomfort but can also risk the spread of infection further into your jaw or potentially to other areas of your body. Seek medical attention as soon as possible. Wish you relief and recovery soon.",
    "406": "Hi, I'm Doctor Chat,\n\nIt sounds like the white spot you're experiencing might indeed be hypopigmentation, which can indeed be caused by an injury or insect bite. The skin in that area has lost some of its pigment, which is why it appears white.\n\nMelgain is a topical solution that is used to repigment the affected area. According to the instructions given by your dermatologists, Melgain needs to be applied to the affected area either once at night for 15 days, then twice a day for a month after. \n\nHere's a general guide on how to use the solution:\n\n1) Gently clean the area of skin where you'll be applying the medicine. Ensure that the skin is dry prior to application.\n\n2) Using the dropper that comes with the Melgain bottle, apply the solution directly to the affected area of skin.\n\n3) Spread the liquid evenly over the skin in that area. There's no need to rub or massage it in — it will be absorbed by the skin naturally.\n\n4) Wash your hands after applying the medication, unless your hands are the area being treated.\n\n5) It's recommended to apply Melgain at nighttime because sunlight can break down the active ingredient in Melgain, decreasing its effectiveness. \n\nAvoid exposure to the sun while using Melgain, and use sunscreen or wear protective clothing if you do need to be outside.\n\nRemember, repigmentation is a slow process and may take several months to notice significant changes.

It's a good thing you have an appointment with your physiotherapist tomorrow, they can do an in-depth physical evaluation. However, due to the numbness and your previous cervical fusion, I'd recommend you also see a neurologist or orthopedic specialist as soon as possible. It's important to get this checked out to prevent any further damage. You may need imaging tests like an X-ray or MRI to assess the extent of the injury. In the meantime, try to limit movement of your neck and avoid activities that cause pain. Continuing to apply ice to any painful areas can help reduce inflammation.",
    "408": "Chest congestion in a patient with a history of angioplasty and stenting could be due to multiple reasons. Whilst the long-distance travel in a bus might be an incidental correlation, it'd be prudent to get it checked out. It could be due to a relatively benign etiology like acid reflux or a respiratory issue, but could also potentially be a warning sign of worsening cardiac disease.\n\nIn such cases, it is advisable to consult with her cardiologist. She should have a thorough physical examination, and possibly an ECG, echocardiogram or stress test to ensure that her heart function hasn't worsened. If these tests are negative, other causes can be explored with a pulmonologist or a gastroenterologist.\n\nMeanwhile, advise her to avoid fatty meals before the journey, keep well hydrated and take frequent breaks with walking during the travel to improve circulation. Please let me know if you have further queries.",
    "409": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way. While it's important to keep in mind that I can't provide a definitive diagnosis online, your symptoms could suggest several issues. Stress and anxiety can certainly cause headaches, dizziness, numbness (pins and needles), and even the agitation and irritability. However, since you're asthmatic and you're having difficulty breathing, this could be a sign of an impending asthmatic attack. Moreover, the sudden \"deadness\" of your left arm is concerning and needs immediate evaluation – it could be a sign of a neurological issue, or in some cases, a cardiovascular event. Lastly, a blood sugar level of 4.1 is relatively low and may contribute to some of the symptoms you're experiencing. It's important to keep a balanced diet to prevent hypoglycemia. Please seek immediate medical attention, and follow through with the CT scan and other recommendations provided by your specialist. It's important to get a clear overall picture of what's going on so that a comprehensive and effective treatment plan can be put in place.",
    "410": "Hello and thank you for your question. Management of Thalassemia requires a close and constant follow-up with a hematologist, and it appears you are maintaining your schedule with frequent blood transfusions. In terms of your travel plans, it's not usually possible to \"stockpile\" blood due to its limited shelf life and specific storage requirements. \n\nTherefore, you will need to do some advanced planning for the medical services you need while on tour with the band. You could contact local hospitals or blood transfusion centers at the places you will be visiting. Communication between them, you, and your home doctors is crucial to ensure a smooth transition and continuation of your needed care. \n\nHowever, this needs to be organized very well, and you would still need a healthcare professional to ensure that the blood transfusion is done properly. This could be done by a travel nurse, but they would still need the support from the local healthcare system. \n\nIt's a good idea to talk to your own doctor about your plans who can help guide and perhaps make arrangements for you. Please remember that your health is your primary concern. You must ensure that your medical needs can be met for the entire period of the tour.",

The infection from your belly button piercing could potentially have spread, especially if it has been present for a significant amount of time. The tiredness, weight loss, and being sick all the time along with chest pain are considerably serious symptoms. \n\nAt this point, it would be very important to quickly seek medical attention. Please contact your healthcare provider immediately. They will likely suggest that you remove the piercing so that the area can heal properly and probably start you on a course of antibiotics, both topical (for the piercing area) and systemic to fight the infection. You might also have chest x-rays or other tests to evaluate the chest pain.\n\nWithout prompt medical treatment, the infection could become worse and potentially develop into a more serious condition like sepsis.\n\nPlease act promptly and see a healthcare professional immediately.",
    "413": "Hello! Based on your description, this could be a blocked sweat gland or hair follicle, which can cause a pimple-like bump to form due to the built up oils or dead skin cells. You may have exacerbated it by scratching or picking at it, which would explain the swelling and redness.\n\nYou did the right thing by leaving it alone afterwards. Try to resist scratching or picking at it while it heals. Keeping the area clean and dry will help, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream can help with any itching or inflammation.  \n\nHowever, if it not improve, gets worse, or if you start noticing similar bumps, it would be a good idea to get checked out by a healthcare provider. Although it's likely something minor and not harmful, it's always better to get a professional opinion to put your mind at rest. \n\nRemember, these comments are for general guidance, and are not a substitute for a full consultation with a doctor.",
    "414": "Hello, a tetanus shot usually provides protection for about 10 years, so your previous vaccination should still provide you with some protection. However, deep wounds or wounds caused by rusted nails might require a booster shot if it's been more than 5 years from your last shot, just to be safe. \n\nThe slightly red and raised area around your scratch could indeed be signs of a possible infection. Tetanus is one concern with rusty nails, but general wound infection from other bacteria is also possible. \n\nI recommend you to see a healthcare provider. They may suggest you to get a tetanus booster shot considering the nature of your injury, and might prescribe you antibiotics if they think an infection is present or likely. Keep the wound clean, apply a topical antibiotic ointment and change your bandages regularly until you are able to see a healthcare provider.",
    "415": "Hello, a sustained higher basal body temperature after ovulation does not necessarily mean that you're infertile. It is quite normal for the basal body temperature to rise after ovulation due to the production of progesterone, a hormone that increases post-ovulation and may cause a woman's body temperature to rise. Typically, if you're not pregnant, your body temperature may drop back to your normal pre-ovulatory temperature right before your period. If you're pregnant, the higher basal body temperature will usually stay elevated. If you are concerned about your fertility, it would be best to consult with a doctor. Infertility is usually defined by trying to conceive for a year or longer without success.",
    "416": "I'm sorry to hear about your persistent chronic cough. If you've already gone through extensive evaluations with pulmonologists and other doctors, and if typical causes such as allergies, asthma, acid reflux, and infections have been ruled out, your cough could be categorised as a \"chronic unexplained cough\". \n\nSuch cases can be quite challenging, but there are still options to consider. You might consider seeing a specialist in what's called \"Cough Clinic\" or \"Cough Centers\" if there's one available in your area. These are clinics that specifically specialize in diagnosing and treating people with persistent, hard-to-explain coughs. \n\nThere are other therapeutic approaches that can sometimes help as well, such as speech therapy, breath control exercises, or nerve and muscle relaxants. \n\nYour current medication, Gabapentin or \"Nurontin\", is a type of nerve pain medication that has been used to treat chronic cough, especially if related to nerve sensitivity. Certain types of antidepressants have also been used under the same principle. \n\nMake sure to continue discussing with your current healthcare provider about your symptoms and your response to the medications. It may take some time and patience to find the correct approach for your case. What's important is not to lose hope and continue seeking out solutions. Your comfort and quality of life are important.",
    "417": "Hello, Your initial blood pressure reading was quite high, but this can be attributed to the vigorous physical activity (running) that you had just completed. Exercise can temporarily increase your blood pressure. The reading at the end of your appointment was still slightly elevated, but much closer to the normal range. \n\nHigh blood pressure doesn't usually cause symptoms, so it's important to have it checked regularly. The only way to know if you have high blood pressure is through regular checkups. This is especially important if you have a close relative who has high blood pressure. \n\nIf your blood pressure is found to be high, it's crucial to take steps to lower it. Lifestyle measures such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, quitting smoking (if you're a smoker) and cutting down on alcohol can help. Sometimes medication may be needed as well. \n\nRemember, if left untreated, high blood pressure can increase your risk for heart disease and other serious health problems. Hence, I would recommend further follow-up with your healthcare provider to discuss these readings and potential next steps.",
    "418": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well. \n\nGiven your situation with a partially blocked intestine and a related fever, it would generally be okay to take ibuprofen (Advil) unless your physician has directed you to avoid it due to potential effects on your gastrointestinal system or because it may mask fever (a sign of infection).\n\nHowever, there are some concerns with using Advil regularly, particularly on an empty stomach. It can cause stomach upset, ulcers or bleeding. If you decide to take it, have it with a liquid meal replacement to protect your stomach.\n\nMoreover, given this is an ongoing issue, it would be better to bring this up with your physician. They have full knowledge of your medical background and the specifics of your current situation, and can therefore provide more accurate advice.\n\nIf the fever does not improve or if it gets worse, it’s very important to contact your physician as soonas possible. A persistent fever could indicate an ongoing infection which may need additional or different treatments.\n\nStay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water or electrolyte solutions, and get as much rest as you can. Your ongoing low-grade fever is your body's way of fighting off an infection, and hydration and rest can both support this process.",
    "419": "Hello and thanks for reaching out. The symptoms you describe, such as low libido, constant tiredness, lack of energy, and lack of focus or concentration could indeed be symptoms of depression as your doctor mentioned. Depression is not only a psychological condition but also affects physical well-being and behaviors. \n\nHowever, it’s also important to check out other potential causes. Conditions such as hypothyroidism, anemia, lower testosterone levels, vitamin D deficiency, and certain chronic illnesses can cause similar symptoms. I recommend having a thorough medical check-up to rule out other possible conditions. \n\nIn the meantime, try to maintain a regular schedule, with balanced meals and regular physical activity, as these can be beneficial regardless of the cause. Consultation with a mental health professional may also be useful in assessing your mental well-being.

    "420": "Nosebleeds in children can be common, and there can be several possible causes, such as dry air, frequent nose-blowing or nose-picking, or an injury to the nose. Swimming could potentially exacerbate a nosebleed if your daughter is holding her breath or blowing her nose often. However, frequent and heavy nosebleeds like you described could indicate an underlying issue such as a problem with blood clotting. \n\nIn regards to your question about the walk-in clinic, it would depend on the specific clinic and the severity of the nosebleeds. Some may be equipped to handle minor cases of cauterization, while others may refer you to an ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat) specialist. After cauterization, your daughter might need to avoid swimming or strenuous activity for a short period to allow the nose to heal. I recommend contacting the clinic ahead of time to verify what services they can provide. \n\nRegardless, given the frequency of the nosebleeds, I believe it would be best for you to seek immediate medical attention for your daughter.",

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) can cause symptoms like chest pain and can be linked with allergies, although it's typically more related with food allergies. Given your symptoms, I would also consider something musculoskeletal given the chest pain, back pain, and the fact that it seems to worsen during certain activities like smoking. I would recommend a consultation with a rheumatologist or orthopedic specialist to rule out any conditions related to the bones, muscles, or connective tissues that could be causing these symptoms. In the interim, I would certainly recommend abstaining or significantly reducing both cigarette and marijuana use, as both can exacerbate underlying conditions and contribute to inflammation.\n",

She has shown an interest in computer usage, which can be a great tool in learning new skills and information. There are several learning platforms online that could cater to her learning pace and style. Encourage her to learn topics she is interested in.\n\nThat being said, it could be beneficial to seek help from professionals who tailor their teaching methods for slow learners.

In addition to Lyme disease, there are other conditions that could cause similar symptoms including other types of infections, autoimmune diseases, or fibromyalgia. As for fibromyalgia, it is a chronic condition that can cause widespread pain, fatigue, and other types of discomfort, so effective management of this condition is key in helping your husband feel better. Ensure he is receiving appropriate treatment for this as well. The management of fibromyalgia is multi-faceted and includes medication, exercise, and sometimes cognitive-behavioral therapy.

From the information you've provided, it appears to be varying from 29 to 38 days. Irregular periods could possibly affect conception and pregnancy but it's not necessarily always the case. Menstrual irregularities could indicate hormonal imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid issues etc., that could affect fertility.\n\nAs for the fertility check-ups for women, it generally includes assessment of hormone levels via blood tests, an ultrasound scan to assess the uterus, ovaries and ovulation, and possibly additional tests based on your doctor's recommendations such as HSG test or Laparoscopy to check the fallopian tubes.\n\nYour semen analysis is important as well, and it's good that it appears normal. \n\nGiven the scenario, yes, I would recommend you both to consult with a gynaecologist.

Given his symptoms of an enlarged liver and spleen, thin blood, and a heart murmur, the possible causes could range from a severe infection, blood disorders, liver diseases or it could be a congenital disorder. Without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nThe medical team treating him are likely running many different diagnostic tests and the answers will come from there. In the meantime, it's important for your nephew to continue to receive supportive care in the hospital. I hope the doctors arrive at a diagnosis soon and start your nephew's treatment.",
    "428": "Hi, Thanks for reaching out about your health concerns. Spontaneous bruising or haematomas that you don't remember getting can be due to minor unnoticed trauma, blood clotting disorders, certain medications, excessive strain during exercise, or less commonly a symptom of a serious medical condition. Given that the bruise is large and fading in an unusual pattern, it would be valuable to seek medical attention and undergo an examination by your doctor. Your doctor may want to know any relevant medical history and could possibly perform some laboratory tests to rule out any blood disorders. The persistent lump could be due to a collection of old blood (resolved hematoma) or scar tissue, and generally will resolve over time, but it would also be best to have this checked in person. I hope this information provides some guidance. Good day! Chat Doctor.",
    "429": "The symptoms you're describing may potentially be due to a number of different conditions, including electrolyte imbalances, stress or anxiety, or even certain heart conditions such as arrhythmias. However, it's essential to properly evaluate your condition. Since you're experiencing chest pain prior to the palpitations, it might be prudent to consult with a cardiologist. They may recommend an EKG, stress test, or even a 24-hour Holter monitor to record your heart's electrical activity. Try to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and stress, as these can sometimes trigger palpitations. But definitely get seen by a professional to rule out any potential heart conditions.",
    "430": "Hello, Sara. I'm sorry to hear about your past miscarriage. Slight anomalies between gestational age and the size of the gestational sac can be common, but a discrepancy of more than a week can sometimes be a concern. It's important to follow up with consistent ultrasound scans to monitor the growth of the baby. As for medications to enhance fetal growth, prenatal vitamins, particularly those containing folic acid, are often prescribed to support healthy fetal growth. Adequate nutrition, regular moderate exercise, and avoidance of harmful substances, like tobacco and alcohol, are also crucial for fostering healthy fetal development. Keep in mind that it's necessary to stay in regular contact with your healthcare provider or gynecologist to ensure the healthiness of your pregnancy. They will be able to guide you best based on your history and current presentation.",
    "431": "I'm really sorry to hear that your father is dealing with such a difficult situation. Given the current situation, it seems like your father's condition is quite complicated and it might be best to get further opinions from specialists. \n\nIf the second doctor you consulted suggests that it could be Skull Base Osteomyelitis, a very serious and rare condition, his advice should be seriously considered. You may want to ask this doctor to explain his reasons, so that you can understand it better.\n\nSince Otogenic skull base osteomyelitis occurs primarily in elderly diabetics, the diagnosis could be plausible. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment, several weeks or months may be required to achieve a clinical cure. \n\nIn addition, given his diabetes, it is possible that his wound healing and immune function are hampered, making it harder for his body to fight infections and recover from them.\n\nPlease consult further with a team of doctors including an endocrinologist(to manage the diabetes better so that healing is quicker), an infectious disease specialist (to handle the infection) and another ENT specialist. Please discuss openly about your concerns with them. They will be in the best position to guide the treatment.\n\nBear in mind this doesn't replace a face-to-face consultation with a doctor.",
    "432": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your accident and the resulting pain. If your pain continues to worsen, it's an indication that you could have suffered a more serious injury than merely bruising. You may have sustained an injury to the soft tissues in the region (ligaments, tendons, muscles), or there might be a fracture in the hip bone itself, considering the pop you felt. \n\nPlease visit a healthcare professional for a proper physical examination and diagnostic tests. This should typically include X-rays or a CT scan to assess if there's any fractures and an MRI to check for tears in the soft tissue structures. In the meantime, continue icing, rest, and avoid putting weight or strain on the painful side.\n\nPlease note this is advice based on the information you gave, and the best course of action is always to consult with a healthcare provider.",
    "433": "Hello, you must have developed rash due to bacterial or fungal infection which is gradually extending towards the belly. I would suggest using antifungal ointments like Clotrimazole along with 1% Hydrocortisone to avoid itching. Over-the-counter antifungal medicines and creams can be effective, and corticosteroid creams might help with severe itching. In case the lesion does not subside in 10-15 days, you should get your blood sugar levels tested as diabetes can also cause infections, and rashes. Another cause for such rashes can be dermatitis due to friction between skin and clothing. It’s necessary that you wear loose fitting clothes in home, and maintain personal hygiene. Also, you need to wash the area with soap water daily. \n\nFor your abdominal discomfort, it could be due to various causes such as gas, indigestion, or a muscle strain. However, if the discomfort and aches persist, I'd advise a consultation with a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management. Monitor your diet carefully and avoid any foods that seem to worsen the symptoms.",
    "434": "Hello,\n\nYour daughter's height and growth pattern appears to be within normal limits given the heights of her parents. Height in children is often determined by genetic factors. As both you and her father are fairly tall, it is not surprising that she is taller than her peers. \n\nEndocrinologists can provide an estimation of final adult height based on current height, growth patterns and bone age, but this is only an estimation and there can always be some deviation from this estimate. \n\nThe monitoring by the endocrinologist is mostly done to ensure that her height growth is progressing at a steady, normal pace and to ensure there are no hormonal imbalances affecting her growth. The fact that her bone age is advanced by a year and a half may prompt the doctor for regular check-ups. \n\nRegarding her self-perception, it would be beneficial to reassure her that everyone is unique and grows at their own rate. Promoting a positive body image can help her accept her height as a part of her unique self.\n\nFinally, if you have any concerns about the specialist’s approach, it would be completely acceptable to seek a second opinion.\n",

    "436": "Hello, \n\nThis is an interesting symptom you're describing. The sensation of liquid moving could be related to your sinuses, which are air-filled spaces inside the skull. When these sinuses are filled with fluid, you may feel or hear a swishing sound. This could be due to sinusitis, allergies, or a cold. The pressure on your head could also be related to sinus problems. \n\nThe cold, tingling, numbing sensation is a bit more challenging to explain. It could potentially be related to nerve irritation, blood flow, or anxiety. \n\nI would suggest you to visit a healthcare provider for a complete physical examination and possibly some imaging of your head and brain to rule out any other possible causes such as migraines or neuralgias. \n\nMeanwhile, try to notice if there are triggers that make these symptoms worse or better, like stress, certain foods or beverages, or sleeping patterns. It may also be useful to keep a symptom diary noting when these sensations happen and what you were doing or how you were feeling at the time.\n\nRemember this advice is intended to be general and informational in nature, and should not be used as a substitute for consulting with a medical professional.",
    "437": "Hello, \n\nBased on your symptoms, it sounds like you may be experiencing a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis, which can cause itching, irritation, and discomfort during sex. It's also possible that you may have an allergic reaction to something you've been exposed to, like a new soap, lubricant, or condom. Regardless of cause, you should definitely reach out to a healthcare provider for an examination. Over-the-counter treatments can help with a yeast infection, but it's always best to confirm the diagnosis first. Avoid scratching as it can lead to more irritation and infection.\n\nAlso, take note if pain during sex continues. Pain during intercourse is not normal and can be a sign of various conditions like endometriosis, fibroids, or pelvic inflammatory disease.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to seek medical attention in order to get relief from your symptoms, and to prevent potential complications. It is important to get the right diagnosis and treatment.\n\n",
    "438": "Hello there, \nThese symptoms can be indicative of multiple conditions, such as hypotension (low blood pressure), dehydration, anemia (low iron levels), irregularities in your heart rhythm or neurological issues. Another possibility can be a condition called orthostatic hypotension, which often triggers dizzy spells upon standing too quickly due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. \nIt is important that you get this examined by a professional healthcare provider. They may suggest tests such as blood work, an Electrocardiogram (ECG), or a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan based on your symptoms and their initial assessment.  \nEven though you've only lost consciousness once, any change or increase in these symptoms should not be overlooked. Please make sure to consult with a healthcare provider to establish the cause and appropriate treatment.",
    "439": "Hi, I appreciate your diligence in maintaining your health. No-alcohol therapy is an important part of managing elevated liver enzymes, but you also need to consider other factors that might be affecting your liver function, such as your diet, medications, weight, and the possibilities of Hepatitis viruses, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or other liver conditions. It might take a bit longer for the liver to recover depending on these factors as well as your age. However, if your liver enzyme levels continue to stay elevated, I would advise seeing your Doctor again for further diagnosis, as sustained high liver enzymes may indicate a more serious issue. They may suggest an ultrasound or biopsy if they suspect any liver diseases.\u0003",
    "440": "Hello, from your information it seems that you have a retroverted uterus which is relatively normal as it doesn't generally affect fertility unless it is caused by a pathological condition. You have a thin, intact endometrium - the lining of the womb where the embryo implants - and you have follices in the right ovary which is a good sign. However, the left ovary appears to not have visible follicles at the time of your check up, but this is not necessarily a permanent situation. Both of your fallopian tubes are patent, meaning open, which is also a good sign for natural conception. \n\nAt your age of 45, natural conception rates generally decline due to a decrease in egg quality and quantity. However, it’s not impossible to get pregnant naturally. It's important to have regular intercourse, particularly around the time of ovulation, to increase your chances of conception.\n\nIf you find you're not conceiving naturally after 6 months of trying and given your age, you may want to consult a fertility specialist to talk about other options that could increase your chances further, such as Intrauterine Insemination(IUI) or In vitro fertilisation (IVF), which might be suitable for your situation. \n\nDo consult with your gynaecologist for further advice. Remember to live healthily, reduce stress as much possible, have a balanced diet and do regular exercise which may improve your chances of conception as well.",

If you are feeling an increasing level of discomfort and are seriously struggling with your breath, then this would be considered a medical emergency and you should seek urgent medical attention right away. \n\nIf the breathing difficulty isn't extreme at this point, you should get in touch with your healthcare provider as soon as possible. They might prescribe antibiotics if they suspect a bacterial infection. In the meantime, over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, throat lozenges or sprays might provide some relief from the throat pain.\n\nFor immediate relief, try drinking cool or warm liquids - such as water or tea with honey, this could help soothe the throat and reduce the swelling temporarily. Avoid cold liquids as it may cause your throat to contract and make it harder to breathe. \n\nRemember, breathing difficulty is a serious symptom and should not be taken lightly. If you're unable to reach your healthcare provider urgently, consider seeking emergency medical assistance.",
    "442": "Hello, it sounds like the symptoms you're experiencing could potentially be due to a rectal or colon issue, perhaps even an anal fissure or rectal polyp. Anal fissures can cause fresh bleeding and a lump near the anus if there's a thrombosed external hemorrhoid, which is a blood clot in an external hemorrhoid. Polyps are abnormal growths that can occur in the rectum or colon, and some can bleed. Larger ones can also cause a sensation of a lump. \n\nTo get to the root cause, the colon specialist will likely conduct a physical exam and possibly order further diagnostic tests such as a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. A colonoscopy allows the doctor to examine the full length of the colon and rectum, while a sigmoidoscopy only examines the last two feet of the colon. These tests allow the provider to see inside your colon and rectum to identify any abnormalities.\n\nIn general, it's very important to follow up with the recommended specialist as rectal bleeding can have many possible causes, and some of them can be serious. It will be important to have this appropriately evaluated, and treatment recommended based on the findings. Your healthcare provider will be able to guide you through what to expect, possible causes, and next steps.",
    "443": "Hello,\n\nYou're asking about Flor Essence herbal tea. This is a type of detox tea that's often used by people seeking to improve their health. The claim on making \"powerful healing water\" possibly relates to the preparation instructions of the product, or the combining of the tea with pure water.\n\nIn terms of results, it can vary greatly from person to person. Some people may feel a positive change within weeks, while others may take a longer time or may not perceive any difference at all. As with any supplement, it's important to discuss this with your doctor, especially since your husband is a prostate cancer survivor.\n\nDoubling up on the recommended dosage is generally not advised without consulting a healthcare professional first. Overdosing on certain ingredients, even those in herbal teas, can potentially cause unwanted side effects.\n\nAs for whether this product can help your husband, that's a very specific question without a straightforward answer. Flor Essence herbal tea is not specifically designed or marketed for cancer treatment or prevention. Your husband's rising PSA levels should be monitored and managed by his healthcare team. They will be able to guide him on the best course of action based on his individual medical history and current health status. Be sure to discuss any new supplements or dietary changes with them.",

The fungal infection near your stomach should ideally be treated with antifungal medications - preferably after a culture is taken to identify the specific fungus.\n\nYour breathing difficulties and weakness are concerning and although you mentioned that you do not have a history of asthma, they may be indicative of an uncontrolled respiratory condition. It is also possible that you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to the fungal infection.\n\nPerforming some breathing exercises can help with your breath control. However, it is very important that you seek immediate medical attention, ideally from a pulmonologist, to investigate your symptoms further especially if they are worsening.\n\nAdditionally, maintaining a good hygiene, keeping the area dry, and applying topical antifungal creams or powders may help with the local fungal infection.

This could mean being evaluated by a team that includes a psychologist, a psychiatrist, a pain specialist, and potentially seen in a program that specializes in chronic pain management.\n\nIf he hasn't tried cognitive behavioral therapy or other forms of psychotherapy yet, this might be quite beneficial. It's been shown to be very effective for chronic pain management and can also help with depression and anxiety. \n\nThis sounds like a very tough situation for your family and I can understand how desperate you must be feeling.

You can use an antiviral drug such as Acyclovir (Zovirax), Valacyclovir (Valtrex) or Famciclovir (Famvir). These drugs are available in India and can greatly speed up healing and can reduce the severity of the lesion if taken at the beginning of the outbreak. However, these are prescription medications and you should consult with your healthcare provider before starting them. \n\nFor immediate relief of the swelling and pain, you could consider over-the-counter medications. You can use a Lip balm or cream to soothe the lip, and for pain relief, you may use Paracetamol (Tylenol). \n\nPlease consult your healthcare provider before beginning any medications.

From the MRI report, it appears there is significant pressure on your spinal cord and nerves exiting from spinal cord leading to central canal stenosis. Non-surgical treatments such as physical therapy and injections might not be effective given the severity of pressure on the spinal cord. Surgical intervention can relieve the pressure on your nerves and spinal cord by removing/discarding the disc fragment causing pressure. However, you should try to get a second opinion before making a decision. This can help you understand all options available and choose the one that's best suited for you. Remember, the final decision is yours, and you should feel comfortable with choosing a particular treatment option.",
    "448": "It's good to hear that you have quit smoking. What you're experiencing could be a symptom of your anxiety or it might be due to nicotine withdrawal since you've recently stopped smoking. Palpitations or sensations of your heart stopping followed by a strong beat are commonly reported symptoms with anxiety and they tend to worsen during periods of rest or just as you are falling asleep.\n\nThe medications you are taking - Zoloft and Neurontin - are known to help with anxiety and should theoretically decrease such sensations. However, all changes in your heart rate and rhythm should be checked by your doctor. Even though it is likely to be related to your anxiety, it is paramount to rule out any cardiac conditions that may present similarly. \n\nI'd recommend bringing this to your doctor's attention, getting a physical check up and potentially an electrocardiogram (ECG) to ensure your heart is functioning correctly. In the meantime, reassure yourself that this is a common symptom of anxiety and try to employ coping mechanisms such as deep breathing or meditation when it happens.",
    "449": "Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. It's not a specific disease but an overall term that describes a wide range of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person's ability to perform everyday activities. While stress and shock can exacerbate cognitive decline in individuals predisposed to dementia, they are typically not the root cause. \n\nEffects of dementia can be cognitive such as memory loss, difficulty with complex tasks, and confusion, as well as psychological like changes in personality, depression, and agitation. There can also be difficulty in physical movement or speech. \n\nWith regards to emotional shocks, like the example of a daughter's divorce, although stress is recognized as a risk factor for and a common component of dementia, it is unlikely to be a sole cause of dementia but could potentially trigger onset in those already susceptible due to other factors such as genetic predisposition or age. Furthermore, the progression and effects of dementia can make processing and coping with such news more challenging. \n\nIt is essential to maintain open, honest communication to help your loved one with dementia understand the situation to the best of their ability and provide comfort and assurance during this potentially confusing time.",

Gallbladder disease, including gallstones, can potentially cause changes in liver texture if there are complications such as a bile duct blockage.\n\nAs to your question about cancer, in general, a \"cloudy\" appearance on a scan is not typically indicative of liver cancer.

Sneezing can put pressure on the lower abdominal area, which might cause minor discomfort, but it should not influence the overall condition of a potential pregnancy. If your wife has allergies and requires antihistamines, some are safe to use during pregnancy, but she should certainly discuss this with her doctor. \n\nAs for the light bleeding, it could be a sign of implantation bleeding, which occurs when a fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus, although this usually happens before the expected date of a period.

    "453": "A psychiatrist and a psychologist are both medical professionals that deal with mental health issues. While the roles can overlap, there are also some fundamental differences:\n\nPsychiatrists are medical doctors, which means they have the ability to prescribe medications.

After medical school, they complete a four-year psychiatric residency during which they learn about the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders.\n\nPsychologists, on the other hand, have a doctoral degree in the field of psychology and are knowledgeable about human behavior, but they are not medical doctors and typically cannot prescribe medications. Instead, they provide various types of therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) to help patients.\n\nRegarding your husband, open communication is key in any relationship. Try to talk to him about the issues you're facing, explain to him that everyone has a different sexual appetite and there needs to be mutual consent and respect. \n\nIf you are feeling unusually nervous, moody or fatigued, it might be good to consult with a healthcare provider. These could be symptoms of perimenopause, but they could also be symptoms of a number of other physical or mental health conditions. \n\nAnd remember, it's important to take care of your mental health.

It could take a year or more of consistent use of topical medications or a combination of treatments like chemical peels, laser, creams etc. \nLoss of skin color and hardness of skin can be due to excessive sun exposure, use of harsh products, or lack of hydration. To restore your skin health, ensure you're using a good quality moisturizer and sunblock regularly. Drink plenty of water and include more fruits and vegetables in your diet. Also, it would be better for you to schedule an appointment with a dermatologist so you can be evaluated and managed appropriately. It's really hard to suggest something without a physical examination. Don't be disheartened, with consistent care, we can always improve the skin. Take care.",
    "465": "I understand your concern, and I'm glad you've generally prioritized your health and that of your baby's throughout most of your pregnancy. Indeed, THC, the main active ingredient in marijuana, is stored in fat cells, so it can stay in the body for quite some time. \n\nThe exact length of time THC stays in the system can vary widely, and depends on many factors, including frequency of use, body fat percentage, metabolism, and hydration. For infrequent users like you, THC is usually detectable in bodily fluids for 1 to 3 days after last use, but can sometimes be detected up to a week after. \n\nRegarding your unborn child, THC can cross the placenta and enter the baby's system. Since neonates have a high body fat percentage, it may take longer for them to eliminate the THC from their systems. \n\nGiven your limited use and the time elapsed, it may or may not be detectable at birth. However, the best way to ensure your baby's health is to abstain from using marijuana or any potentially harmful substances. It's also important to be open with your healthcare provider about your use, as honesty with them can only benefit your health and the health of your baby.",
    "466": "Hello, If you tested positive for HBsAg, it means you are currently infected with the hepatitis B virus. However, it seems like you have a chronic infection because you mentioned the HBsAg has been positive since 1995. The level of HBsAg does not correlate with liver damage or disease severity. Instead, it is used in combination with other lab test results, including HBV DNA and liver function tests, to evaluate the status of hepatitis B infection. The negative HBeAg result indicates that the virus is less active but does not mean you cannot spread the virus to others. Continue to keep regular appointments with your doctor and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Abstain from alcohol as it may increase liver damage. Talk to your doctor about your test results and do not hesitate to ask any questions you may have about your condition. Regular monitoring is crucial in managing chronic hepatitis B.",
    "467": "Hi Mohana, I'm sorry to hear about your experiences. Recurrent miscarriages can be really hard. Considering your history of recurrent miscarriages, it would be important to carry out certain investigations like a complete hormonal profile, anti-phospholipid antibody test, and maybe even genetic testing. \n\nYour doctor also might consider offering progesterone supplementation or low-dose aspirin in the next pregnancy, as it could increase the chances of a successful pregnancy. \n\nYou should continue eating a healthy diet, quit smoking if applicable, lessen alcohol intake if applicable, and start taking prenatal vitamins. Also, engaging in moderate exercise can contribute to a healthy pregnancy. \n\nYour chance of a successful pregnancy in the future is quite good, especially since you've had a successful pregnancy in the past. Make sure to stay positively engaged in your goal of having another child.\n\nRemember, it is very important to maintain communication with your healthcare professional and follow their advice. In some cases, assistance from a specialist in reproductive endocrinology and infertility might be beneficial.\n\nI hope this information helps and I wish you the best of luck.",
    "468": "Based on your symptom history and your past medical history of breast cancer, there are several possibilities, including gastritis, a peptic ulcer, or some type of gastrointestinal malignancy. The presence of black stool might have suggested bleeding high in your digestive tract, possibly due to an ulcer or gastritis. However, your ulcer and Helicobacter Pylori tests came back negative. \n\nThe symptoms of feeling full quickly and experiencing pain after eating point toward a potential issue with your pancreas, such as pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Given your past history of cancer, it's important to rule out a malignancy. Musculoskeletal issues such as a rib fracture or muscle strain are also possible, but less likely given your symptoms. \n\nUltimately, further diagnostic testing, including imaging studies and potentially an endoscopy, may be necessary to clarify the cause of your pain. I recommend you to consult with a gastroenterologist. Please follow up with your doctor regarding these symptoms, the suggestion of further testing and to discuss these possibilities.",
    "469": "Hello, Acinetobacter Lwoffii is a bacteria that is known to cause several types of infection including skin and wound infections. Given that the initial culture from the biopsy site showed MRSA which is a different type of bacteria, it would be reasonable to have another culture done. The new antibiotic will be aimed at treating Acinetobacter Lwoffii, and wouldn't work well against MRSA. So, you're right to request another culture before starting a new antibiotic. Also, make sure the hygiene practices are well maintained like washing hands regularly, keeping the wound clean and dry, and not sharing personal items like towels with others. Do follow up closely with your doctors.",
    "470": "Hello, thanks for reaching out. What you're describing may not be a lump as such. Considering the mobility and location of this 'lump', it might be that you are palpating normal anatomical structures like the tendons or muscles (for instance, the trapezius or sternocleidomastoid muscle or part of the clavicle) that become more prominent when the arm is lifted. \n\nHowever, if you notice any changes in the size, texture, or if it starts to become painful, it's important that you visit a healthcare provider for a physical examination. This would rule out other possibilities like an enlarged lymph node, lipoma, or cyst which can also occur in this region. \n\nFor now, it's important not to stress or overtly manipulate the area, just keep an eye on it for any changes.",
    "471": "Hi there, it sounds like you might be dealing with something known as postural back pain. This is a type of back pain that is caused by maintaining a certain posture for long periods of time. Given your symptom of pain after standing or walking for 4-5 hours, it's very possible this could be the cause. \n\nHeating and stretching are both helpful, as you have found, and it's great to hear that the stretching seems to be offering a bit of relief. I would recommend continuing to heat the area for temporary relief when you need it, and continuing to stretch as well.\n\nHowever, because this has been going for a few months, I would still recommend seeing a doctor, who can examine your back and make sure there are no more serious underlying causes to your back pain. They may be able to help you work on strategies to prevent the pain, such as strengthening exercises or recommendations for ergonomics in your everyday activities.  \n\nIn the meantime, try to take breaks during those long periods of standing or walking, and try to maintain good posture, keeping your back straight, while doing these activities. Also, you can use over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, as long as you don't have any contraindications to them.\n  \nPlease note that without a proper physical examination, it's not definitively possible to diagnose your situation. Please seek medical care in person for a conclusive diagnosis.",
    "472": "Your symptoms could be due to various causes, and it's important to get a comprehensive assessment. Given your history of low blood pressure, the dizziness and feeling like you're about to pass out could be related to orthostatic hypotension. This happens when your blood pressure drops significantly as you stand up from sitting or lying down. \n\nThe constant exhaustion despite adequate sleep could be due to a variety of conditions such as anemia, thyroid disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome, sleep disorders (like sleep apnea), or depression.\n\nIt's also possible that your stuffy head is related to a chronic sinus condition, migraines, or tension headaches. All of these conditions can sometimes make you feel dizzy. \n\nIn light of your symptoms persisting for a few months, I'd strongly recommend you to see your doctor for a thorough evaluation. Your doctor might want to perform some investigations like a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, a sinus x-ray or CT scan, or sleep studies to get to the root of your symptoms. \n\nRemember, it's crucial not to self-diagnose, and visiting a healthcare professional will provide the most accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment course.",
    "473": "Hello, it can be common to need a second course of antibiotics if the infection wasn't completely cleared up after the first round. However, it's also possible that the bacteria could be resistant to ciprofloxacin, which is why it didn't clear up the first time. I would recommend getting a urine culture and sensitivity test done to determine what type of bacteria is causing the infection and which antibiotic it's most sensitive to. This will help your doctor prescribe the most effective treatment. Remember to take the antibiotic exactly as prescribed and complete the entire course to ensure that the infection is completely cleared. If you continue to have symptoms or if they worsen, let your doctor know right away. High blood pressure and abdominal pain can also be due to causes other than kidney infection so it's important to get evaluated for other conditions as well.",
    "474": "Hello, this sounds like it could be a possible issue with your temporomandibular joint (TMJ), which is the hinge-like joint where your jaw meets your skull. It could also be related to an infection or issue with one of your teeth on your upper jaw.\n\nTo provide immediate pain relief, over-the-counter pain medications such as Ibuprofen can help. Additionally, topical pain relievers and/or oral gels applied to the affected area can numb the pain temporarily. Eating softer foods and avoiding extreme jaw movements (like wide yawning, loud singing, and gum chewing) are also advised.\n\nHowever, please note that these suggestions can only provide temporary relief, and are not definite treatments. I highly recommend you visit your dentist or a health care professional as soon as possible to find the source of the issue and determine a proper treatment plan.\n\nIf the pain grows worse or if you experience other symptoms such as fever, head or neck pain, or swelling, seek medical attention immediately. This could suggest a more serious condition which needs immediate care. \n\nTake care and wish you a speedy recovery!",
    "475": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing discomfort. There are several possibilities that could explain the symptoms you are experiencing. \n\nOne could be an abscessed tooth - even if your wisdom teeth aren't erupting, infections can still occur around the tooth or surrounding gum and can potentially cause bumps, headache and earache. Another possibility could be a salivary gland blockage or infection, which can result in swollen and painful areas in the mouth. Certain types of oral cancer can also present these symptoms.\n\nOther possibilities include oral thrush, canker sores, or mucoceles, which are harmless and usually resolve on their own, but can be bothersome in terms of symptoms.\n\nGiven that this is causing you pain and discomfort, it's very important that you make an appointment with an oral surgeon or dentist for an exam. They may need to take X-rays or do other tests to determine the cause. In the meantime, try to keep the area clean and avoid touching or picking at it. Over-the-counter pain relievers may also help reduce your discomfort until you can get to the dentist. Drink plenty of water and maintain good oral hygiene. \n\nPlease keep in mind that while these are possible explanations, without a physical exam it's impossible to provide an accurate diagnosis. If your symptoms worsen or persist, please seek immediate medical attention.",

Kindly see your doctor as soon as possible for a thorough re-evaluation of your condition. An ECG may be needed as well, just to ensure that your heart is not at risk. Please also keep in mind that it's important to manage your weight with a balanced diet and regular exercise, which you have been doing. Losing weight can sometimes take longer as the body needs time to adapt to new habits. Perhaps consider consulting a nutritionist who can help optimize your diet.",
    "477": "Hello. Your symptoms are a bit unusual. Tongue cramping could happen due to a variety of reasons, including nerve irritations, dehydration, certain medications, or a general lack of vitamins or minerals, particularly vitamin B12 or potassium. Recurring cramping, however, should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. \n\nThe bump on your tongue may be related, and may be a sign of injury (due to biting your tongue, for example), a canker sore, or even oral cancer. Depending on the source, it could be contributing to the cramping you feel. \n\nGiven the symptoms, I would suggest you see your primary care doctor or a dentist. They might be able to diagnose the cause in a simple office visit. In the meantime, ensure you are maintaining good oral hygiene and staying hydrated.",
    "478": "I'm sorry to hear about your fall. From what you are describing, it's possible that you may have injured your knees or your foot during your fall, or developed a condition called plantar fasciitis, which is a common source of heel pain and can be triggered by walking a lot. The burning in your knee could be due to inflammation or injury to the nerves or soft tissues around the knee joint. It's hard to diagnose exactly without a physical exam or imaging.\n\nWhile waiting to see a specialist, it can often help to rest your feet and avoid activities that cause pain, apply ice to the area, and take nonprescription pain relievers if the pain is bothersome. Wearing supportive shoes and inserts can also help relieve foot pain and correct issues with your gait that may be contributing to knee and foot discomfort.\n\nHowever, I strongly recommend you to make an appointment with an orthopedic specialist or a podiatrist who can better assess your condition and suggest appropriate treatments. Please do this as soon as possible, especially since this has been going on since January. It's important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan to avoid further damage and to start healing correctly.",
    "479": "Based on your description, it sounds like you may be experiencing a phenomenon called \"vascular pooling\" or \"vein distension\". This is usually common and normal, particularly in individuals who work out or lift heavy weights.\n\nWhen you engage in intense physical exertion, your heart pumps a significant amount of blood to the muscles you're using, which can cause your veins to temporarily distend and feel like lumps under your skin. When you rest or elevate your arms, the blood starts to return to your heart and the lumps should subside.\n\nIt's generally not a cause for concern if the lumps disappear after you relax or raise your arms. However, you might want to keep track of how often these lumps appear and if they are associated with any pain or discomfort.\n\nThis is based on your brief description. If the lumps persist or if you are experiencing additional symptoms such as pain, weakness, numbness or any other health changes, I strongly advise you to schedule a visit with your primary care physician or a vascular specialist for a complete evaluation and potentially ultrasound of the veins. As I often tell my patients: when in doubt, check it out. Stay healthy!",
    "480": "Hi, it's possible that the meal you ate, which was quite heavy and likely high in fats and sodium, may have contributed to the tightness you experienced in your chest. Heavy meals can place stress on the heart, as they require more energy to digest and can lead to higher blood pressure and increased heart rate. Occasionally, they can also cause heartburn, which can sometimes feel like chest tightness or pain. However, given your history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and the fact that you're experiencing chest discomfort, I would recommend you seek immediate medical attention to rule out any serious cardiovascular issues.

    "481": "Hello,\n\nI understand your concern and I appreciate your kindness to help your brother and sister-in-law, your situation is indeed unique.\n\nTubal reversal, also known as tubal reanastomosis, is a procedure that can restore fertility to a woman after a tubal ligation. The success of the reversal is dependent on a few factors, such as the method of the original tubal ligation, the amount of healthy tube remaining, and the age of the woman. \n\nThe procedure usually involves removing the portion of the fallopian tube that was blocked and reconnecting the remaining sections to allow for the passage of eggs. If there is a sufficient amount of healthy tube, the chances of successful pregnancy can be fairly high, especially in younger women. However, at the age of 39, fertility naturally starts to decline, which can further reduce the success rate.\n\nSince there are a lot of specifics to consider in your situation, it would be best to consult with a fertility specialist who can accurately weigh the potential benefits and risks and guide you to make the best decision.\n\nAdditionally, it's crucial to note that tubal reversal doesn't guarantee a pregnancy, and it can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy.\n\nAs an alternative, you may want to consider IVF using your own sperm and your wife's eggs, which have a good success rate and do not involve surgery.\n\nI hope this information helps. Feel free to reach out if you have more questions. Good luck!",
    "482": "It's quite normal for people, including children, to pass gas throughout the day. It's part of the digestive process. If your son's flatulence seems excessive, it could be related to his diet. Foods such as beans, lentils, broccoli, cabbage, onions, and carbonated drinks are known to cause gas. Some people also have difficulty digesting lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products, which can lead to increased gas. Anxiety or swallowing air when eating or drinking can also contribute. \n\nHowever, if these habits persist and are accompanied by other symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, or blood in the stool, you should seek medical advice. Discomfort, feelings of bloating, and increased flatulence can be a sign of a digestive disorder. In the meantime, ensure your son is eating a healthy, balanced diet, drinking plenty of water, and getting regular exercise, all of which can help regulate digestion. If you're concerned, please consult a pediatrician.",
    "483": "Good morning. After any kind of potential exposure to rabies, it's important to clean the wound thoroughly with soap and water, which your husband did. This can greatly reduce the risk of infection. However, if the dog that bit your husband was not vaccinated against rabies, or its vaccination status is unknown, it's very important to start post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). This involves a series of vaccinations. TT (Tetanus Toxoid) injection is not a substitute for rabies immunization. \n\nAs for diet, there are no specific restrictions, but it's generally a good idea to eat a balanced diet to support overall health and immune function. There's no need to specifically avoid jaggery or groundnuts unless advised by a doctor due to reasons unrelated to this incident.\n\nI strongly urge your husband to see a healthcare provider immediately for assessment and potential rabies vaccination. It's always better to take this disease seriously, as rabies is fatal once symptoms appear. They will be able to provide the most appropriate advice based on the specifics of his situation.",

The symptoms you're describing may potentially indicate several conditions, ranging from gastric ulcers, hernias, gallbladder inflammation, pancreatitis or other gastrointestinal issues. However, it's important to note that diagnosing this condition accurately needs a thorough clinical examination and further investigations like an ultrasound or endoscopy. \n\nConsidering the intensity and duration of your pain, I would strongly recommend you seek immediate medical help. Visit the nearest emergency department right away or call an ambulance if necessary. Don't try to self-medicate or ignore the symptoms, as some of these conditions can be serious if not treated promptly.\n\nAfter medical stabilization, make sure to have a follow-up visit with a gastroenterologist for more detailed evaluation and targeted treatment.",
    "485": "Given your history, the pain management doctor will look for ways to manage your pain. They might consider different types of pain relievers like NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), Cox-2 inhibitors, acetaminophen, or, depending on the severity of your pain, opioids for a short duration. Other options include antidepressants or antiseizure medications, which are also effective in managing different types of chronic pain. However, medication is only a part of the treatment plan. They might also propose rehabilitation programs to strengthen your back and core muscles or different types of interventions like nerve blocks. These will depend on your specific situation and the doctor's evaluation. Please remember, appropriate follow-up is really important in chronic pain management. It's not only about prescribing medication but also adapting it to your response and changes in your condition.",
    "486": "Hi, Myasthenia gravis is a lifelong medical condition and the mainstay of treatment is symptomatic management. The first drug of choice is usually Pyridostigmine and your doctor has prescribed Myestin (which contains Pyridostigmine) to your father. This helps to control the symptoms of the disease by improving muscle strength.\n\nAzathioprine (Azoran) is an immunosuppressive medication that aims at reducing the body's immune response, which is mainly responsible for the symptoms of Myasthenia gravis. It helps by reducing the production of acetylcholine receptor antibodies which, in turn, reduces the severity of muscle weakness. \n\nThe decision to start Azathioprine should be based on the severity of your father's symptoms and if there is any significant disability due to the condition. This medication does have potential side-effects like lowering white blood cell count, making one more prone to infections, liver impairment among others. Regular monitoring is needed once Azathioprine is started.\n\nYour father's doctor has suggested this medication based on his/her knowledge of your father's condition and this advice must be respected. However, if you have concerns about starting Azathioprine, I recommend consulting with the doctor again or getting a second opinion from another neurologist. \n\nThis can help in understanding the benefits and potential risks associated with this medication. In the meantime, do keep a regular check on your father's symptoms and report any new or worsening symptoms to",
    "487": "Hello. From what you have described, it sounds like you may have a dental abscess or a pericoronal flap. This is a pocket of pus that develops due to a bacterial infection, in this case possibly due to an infection at the site of your removed wisdom tooth. It can result in tooth pain and swelling which could explain the lump and discomfort. I would strongly recommend you see a dentist as soon as possible as it may require treatment such as draining the abscess, antibiotics, or in some cases further dental procedures. In the meantime, rinsing your mouth with warm salt water can help soothe the area. It's also important to maintain good oral hygiene including thorough brushing and flossing to prevent future infections. Remember, any advice given online should not replace a face-to-face consultation with a healthcare professional. ",

The inconsistency of your menstrual cycle, and the changes in the consistency of your menstrual blood, as well as your difficulty conceiving, could be due to a number of conditions such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or endometriosis. I recommend that you return to your doctor for further discussions and possibly more testing to rule out these conditions.  In the meantime, make sure to eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, avoid stress, and maintain a healthy weight as all these can contribute to hormonal balance and optimize your fertility.

You should definitely mention your misunderstanding of the medication instructions and the symptoms you've been experiencing. It's possible that these symptoms might be related to your medication, or they could be related to something different.  If you are experiencing significant discomfort or if your symptoms worsen, you should seek immediate help. Drinking a large amount of water as you have been doing is great for kidney health but if you're feeling like you need to urinate constantly, it could potentially indicate a urinary tract infection.

    "490": "Hello. If your pet dog is regularly vaccinated against rabies and is healthy, the risk of transmission is lower. However, it's still important to monitor the pet's behavior for any signs of rabies over the next 10 days. Unprovoked aggression can be a sign of rabies. \n\nFollowing any animal bite, it's essential to clean the wound thoroughly with soap and water, and to seek medical advice. Tetanus vaccine (TT injection) is warranted, and you've also received the first dose of the rabies vaccine (IDRV). \n\nAs for the HRIG (human rabies immunoglobulin), it's typically given to people who are at high risk. This includes those who've been bitten by a suspected rabid animal, or those with multiple or deep wounds. HRIG is often recommended for such patients if it's within the first week of first vaccine dose and no serum (like Equirab) was given at the time of the bite.\n\nIf your bite is not severe, HRIG might not be necessary. However, as practical aspects of risk assessment and management can vary, it's best to maintain open communication with your healthcare provider. He or she can provide information that's most applicable to your situation. \n\nRemember, completing the full course of the rabies vaccine after exposure is important to prevent potential infection. The typical schedule is on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 from the day of the first vaccine dose.",
    "491": "Hi, I understand your concern. The visibility of veins on the surface of our skin can be influenced by many factors such as the amount of fat under our skin, our muscle mass, the size of the vein, our skin complexion, and even our age. Some people naturally have more visible veins than others. It's completely normal for veins to be more visible on one arm than the other. As long as there's no pain, swelling or color changes, it's likely nothing to be worried about. Continue to monitor it and if any changes occur, be sure to consult a healthcare professional. As you get older and potentially gain more muscle mass, it might become more visible.",
    "492": "Hello, given your platelet count of 542, it's slightly above the normal range (typically 150-400) and should definitely be monitored by a hematologist. It does not necessarily mean there is anything seriously wrong, but it's always best to follow up on these things, especially when suggested by a physician. Diseases such as inflammation, anemia, cancer, or infection could lead to an elevated platelet count, but sometimes it can just be due to a normal variation as well. \n\nRegarding your elevated TSH level, it indicates that your thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormones, which can lead to conditions like hypothyroidism. This is common with age, and sometimes can also be influenced by certain medication or illnesses. It is also recommended to follow up on this with your doctor to determine if treatment is required. \n\nSo in both cases, while you shouldn't panic, you should continue with further diagnostics to rule out any potential issues.

They might suggest an MRI for a more detailed look at the soft tissues around your hip. Additionally, physical therapy may be beneficial for healing and strengthening the area.\n\nIn the meantime, you could try rest, ice, and gentle stretching exercises to ease the pain, but ensure not to overdo it and risk further injury. Over-the-counter pain relievers under proper direction can also be used for additional pain relief.

    "494": "Hello, you're already making great first steps by avoiding triggers such as smoke, cold air, and chemicals. It's terrific that you've identified these as triggers for your asthma. Being in an environment away from smokers will certainly help your condition. \n\nWhile it's not common for asthma to completely disappear, the severity and frequency of symptoms can be reduced over time with the right treatment and management strategies. Many individuals find that their asthma symptoms improve as they get older. However, each case is unique and it will depend on various factors, such as your overall health status and exposure to certain triggers or allergens.\n\nRegular exercise, when done in an asthma-friendly way, can also help improve lung functioning and overall health. A gradual warming up and cooling down can help prevent exercise-induced asthma attacks. \n\nTalk to your doctor about potentially reassessing your asthma action plan and medication. Sometimes adjustments are needed to better manage the condition. Also, if stress or anxiety trigger your asthma, consider counseling or stress-relief techniques like yoga or meditation. \n\nThere is always hope when it comes to managing asthma and it's likely that your condition will improve with a good management plan. It's crucial to work in coordination with your healthcare provider to create a plan that's tailored for you. Continue avoiding triggers and taking medicines as directed by your doctor.",
    "495": "I'm sorry to hear about the discomfort you're experiencing right now. Prostate swelling and urinary tract symptoms, such as painful urination, can certainly occur after prostate cancer treatment like brachytherapy. These symptoms can also be due to a condition called radiation cystitis that can occur as a late side effect of radiation therapy. This involves inflammation and possible damage to the bladder and urinary tract.\n\nBecause your tests have come back negative for infections, it seems like inflammation may be the most likely culprit behind your symptoms. While Elmiron and Rapaflo are used to help with urinary frequency and bladder discomfort, it's clear these have not provided you with relief.\n\nMy recommendation would be to go back to your urologist and discuss these symptoms in detail again. It may be helpful to have some different types of imaging done like an MRI or CT scan to better visualize the area and rule out other potential causes. In the meantime, ensure you're drinking plenty of fluids, avoid caffeine and alcohol as these can irritate the bladder, and try to empty your bladder regularly. \n\nIn some cases, interventional procedures may be considered such as bladder instillations where medications are placed directly in the bladder to help decrease inflammation. For severe cases, a procedure called hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be an option. This involves breathing in pure oxygen in a pressurized room or tube, and has been shown to be effective in some cases of radiation cystitis. \n\nBest wishes, your symptoms are well",

Your partner's symptoms suggest that he too may have had a yeast infection, and it's recommended that he sees a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis if symptoms recur.\n\nIn the meantime, you should refrain from sexual activity until both partners are symptom-free. Even if the infection seems to go away on its own or with over-the-counter medication, there's a chance that the underlying infection hasn't completely resolved and can be passed back and forth during intercourse.\n\nAbout your question correlating yeast infections with endometriosis, there isn't any direct link or increased propensity. However, some believe that individuals with endometriosis may have weakened immune systems, making them more susceptible to infections in general. \n\nYou can prevent yeast infections by:\n1. Wearing breathable, cotton underwear and avoiding tight clothing.\n2. Eating a well-balanced diet and considering probiotics. \n3.

Not douche because it can change the natural balance of vaginal bacteria.\n\nRemember, persisting or reoccurring symptoms should be reviewed by a healthcare provider to ensure appropriate treatment.",
    "498": "Hello, your husband's symptom could possibly be due to a large umbilical blackhead (a type of acne), small umbilical hernia, or possibly a benign or malignant growth. It's very important for him to be examined by a doctor, especially since he's experiencing pain. A doctor would be able to better evaluate the lump and possibly recommend a biopsy if they deem it necessary. Avoid trying to remove or pop the lump at home, as this could potentially lead to an infection. Please encourage your husband to see a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment.",
    "499": "Hello, thanks for using Chat Doctor.\n\nIt sounds like you're dealing with urinary retention due to your kidney stone. It's good that you have already seen a doctor and have a treatment plan in place.\n\nIf you're experiencing tightness in your legs and swelling in your face, these might be signs of fluid retention caused by decrease in kidney function or urine out as effectively as it should be, so the fluid remains in your body, causing swelling.\n\nHowever, the swelling could also be due to other causes, such as a reaction to the catheter itself or another underlying health issue.\n\nPlease contact your doctor as soon as possible to discuss these symptoms. If you cannot reach them and your symptoms become severe, you might need to seek emergency medical attention.\n\nIn the meantime, try to maintain hydration, but avoid excessive fluid intake. Monitor your symptoms, and try to rest and elevate your legs where possible. Avoid salt as it may contribute to fluid retention. But again, it's very important that these symptoms get evaluated by a healthcare provider.",
    "500": "I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well. Ranitidine is a medication that decreases stomach acid production. It is commonly used in treatment of peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. \n\nIf you don't have a history of these conditions and since Ranitidine didn't bring you relief, your stomach pain may not necessarily be related to high stomach acid. It could be due to other reasons such as viral or bacterial infections, food poisoning, kidney stones or even appendicitis. \n\nGiven the severity of your pain, it's advisable to seek prompt medical attention. You need a physical exam and possibly lab testing or imaging to identify the cause of your symptoms. \n\nRemember not to eat any solid foods, dairy, or spicy foods until you receive professional medical help. Try sipping at water or other clear fluids to keep hydration up. Avoid lying flat and try more of a reclining position for comfort.\n\nPlease visit the nearest healthcare provider immediately.",
    "501": "Hello, it's understandable that you're concerned. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can indeed mimic some symptoms of pregnancy and can also cause irregular periods or menstrual cycles to stop. However, most home pregnancy tests are very accurate about a week after a missed period. If you've taken a test and it's negative, it's likely that you are not pregnant. However, given your symptoms and concerns, I highly recommend you see a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation. They can conduct a blood test, which is more accurate than a home urine test, and evaluate your symptoms to help rule out other potential causes, such as hormonal imbalances related to your PCOS.",
    "502": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. It sounds like you may be experiencing a viral illness or possibly even anxiety. Viral illnesses can cause fatigue, nausea, and a rapid heart rate, among other symptoms. However, if you have been feeling a lot of stress and anxiety, these feelings can manifest with similar physical symptoms. It's also worth considering that dehydration can cause these symptoms as well. I would recommend that you ensure you're drinking enough fluids, and try to rest as much as you can. You could also try some gentle neck stretches for your neck pain. If your symptoms persist or worsen over the next day or two, or if your neck pain becomes severe, I would suggest seeking medical attention.",
    "503": "I'm sorry to hear your daughter is unwell. From what you've described, it seems like she might be having symptoms of asthma, which often includes chest tightness and difficulty breathing, especially at night. The symptom of not being able to smell may indicate a nasal or sinus issue, which can sometimes occur concurrently with respiratory issues like asthma. Her wrist pain, however, might be unrelated; it could be due to different causes such as strain or sprain. \n\nGetting her evaluated for asthma and other respiratory conditions like allergy is necessary at this point. This could involve specific lung function tests in addition to blood tests and skin prick tests to check for allergies. If these issues have already been ruled out or if the symptoms persist, you may want to consider seeking a second opinion from another doctor or a specialist in pulmonology (respiratory medicine) or allergology. \n\nIt's important your daughter continues to seek and follow medical advice, as untreated breathing issues can potentially be serious. If her wrist pain persists or worsens, please also seek an assessment for this. ",
    "504": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. I appreciate your efforts to inform us in details about your mental health issue and medication history. From your account, it appears that the depressive phase of your illness has been more problematic for you, rather than the episodes of elevated mood. Hence, you need a medication which targets the depression effectively. Your psychiatrist may also think about augmenting the standard mood stabilizer with an antidepressant, if required. Increasing the dose of citalopram may have helped to lift your mood, but it can also increase the risk of future episodes of high mood, that is why it is not advisable to increase the dose without supervision from your psychiatrist.\n\nRegarding your thoughts of self-harm and intrusive thoughts, you should reach out to your doctor immediately and discuss these with them. They could be a reaction to changes in your medication and worsening of your depression. It's possible that what you're experiencing is a sign that your medication needs adjusting.\n\nRemember, it's very important to always consult a healthcare provider before changing your medication doses. Finally, the psychological and psychotherapy aspects of treatment are also very important, don't underestimate the importance of these. Please take care.",
    "505": "Hello, elevated ALT and AST levels can sometimes indicate liver damage or disease. In your case, levels are not excessively high, but are outside of the normal range. Aleve, which contains naproxen, does have the potential to increase the levels of liver enzymes, although this is not commonly observed with use as directed. It's also worth noting that even moderate alcohol consumption can contribute to liver enzyme levels. If you're concerned, my advice would be to repeat the tests in a few weeks time, perhaps cutting back on alcohol and discontinuing the Aleve if possible, to see if this makes a difference. Please follow up with your healthcare provider to discuss these results and your concerns.",
    "506": "Hello, thank you for your query. For a chipped tooth, if it is a small fragment, it cannot usually be reattached. However, if it is a significant part or the entire tooth, it should be placed in milk or saliva until it can be delivered to the dental office. This has to do primarily with keeping the tooth cells alive. Storing in milk helps in maintaining the right degree of moisture and prevents the tooth from drying - it doesn't have to be whole milk. You don't have to refrigerate it; just ensure the tooth fragment is completely covered in milk. Please see your dentist at your earliest convenience for proper evaluation and treatment. I hope this helps!",
    "507": "I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis. The procedure you've described - a Total Abdominal Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo-oophorectomy - is a common and aggressive approach to removing the cancer, but your concern regarding its invasive nature is understandable.\n\nLess invasive surgical options may include laparoscopic surgery or robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery. In these, small incisions are made and the uterus is removed in pieces. However, whether these procedures are an option for you depend on a variety of factors, including the stage and extent of your cancer, your overall health, and the expertise and equipment available at your treatment center. \n\nThe benefit of the traditional open surgery is that it allows for a more comprehensive examination of the abdominal cavity, better staging of the cancer, and the assurance that all visible disease has been removed.\n\nI strongly recommend that you discuss your concerns and these potential alternatives with your surgeon or a gynecologic oncologist to ensure the best approach for your specific situation.",
    "508": "Hello, I understand your concern. The sensations of rapid heart rate and shaking can be scary. These symptoms could be related to arrhythmias or certain types of anxiety or panic disorders, especially if there are no other accompanying symptoms like chest pain, breathlessness, dizziness or fainting. First, an Electrocardiogram (ECG) and possibly a Holter Monitor (a device you wear for 24-48 hours that records your heart rhythms) should be done to rule out any heart rhythm abnormalities. If these tests come back normal, you might need to speak with a mental health professional as conditions such as anxiety and panic disorder can cause similar symptoms. As with any health concern, it is best to see a doctor in person so they can fully assess you. But meanwhile, try to keep yourself calm before going to bed, avoid caffeine and stress as it can trigger such episodes. Please do not hesitate to go to an emergency room if your symptoms worsen.",
    "509": "Hello, thank you for your query. From your description, it seems like the procedure might have irritated the sciatic nerve. This can result in sciatica, which is characterized by pain, numbness, or weakness in the leg. Generally, the inflammation and the resulting symptoms should subside over time. It's important to rest and avoid any strenuous activities for a while. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatories and pain relievers may also be beneficial. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible for further evaluation. It may be helpful to verify the cause of the pain and to rule out any other potential issues related to your lumbar puncture.",
    "510": "Hello, this swelling near the jaw could be due to a number of reasons including infection (like parotitis which is infection of salivary glands), dental issues such as impacted wisdom teeth, or even lymph node enlargement which can be due to a systemic infection. Even without toothache, dental issues can present in this way. The fact that it's been recurring makes it important to get it checked out. Seeing a doctor in person would help determine exactly what it is by doing some physical examination and possibly some investigations. Applying a warm compress and maintaining good oral hygiene could provide some relief in the meantime. Please consult as soon as possible.",
    "511": "Hello, \n\nImmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is commonly categorized into two forms: acute and chronic. Acute ITP often occurs in children, resolves within 2 months, and is often preceded by a viral infection. Chronic ITP lasts 6 months or more and adults are primarily affected. \n\nSince you're 18, you're on the borderline between childhood and adulthood, and without knowing more about your case I can't confidently say which type you have. That's a question that your own hematologist, who knows your case details, can answer.\n\nRegarding ITP recurrence, the disease process can indeed recur, resulting in a drop in platelet counts; however, many patients with ITP never have another episode. \n\nAs for your menstrual flow, heavy bleeding is a symptom of ITP. Even though your platelet count is within the normal range, it could take some time for your body to adjust and for your menstrual flow to decrease in volume. If this continues, I recommend speaking with your doctor about it to explore if there could be another cause behind it. Hormonal imbalances too can lead to heavy menstrual bleeding.\n\nHope this answer helps you! Please do not hesitate to get back for further questions.",
    "512": "Hello Kelsie, \nIrregular periods can make conception more difficult because you can't as easily anticipate when you'll ovulate and can conceive. If you are 4 days past your expected period start day, you are in a timeframe where a home pregnancy test could tell you if you are pregnant.\nThe queasy feeling and food aversion could be signs of early pregnancy, but they also could be caused by many other things including stress, routine stomach upset, etc. If you test negative on a home pregnancy test and these symptoms continue, I would suggest speaking with your healthcare provider.\nTo increase your chances of conception, maintain a healthy lifestyle: eat a balanced diet, get regular exercise, and maintain a healthy weight. You're already doing a good thing by taking a multivitamin with folic acid.\nKeep in mind that you may have to try for up to a year before successfully conceiving. If after another six months you are still not pregnant, you might consider visiting a fertility specialist.\nKeep up the efforts, and try not to be stressed about conceiving. Stress itself can sometimes make conception harder to achieve. Good luck.\n\n",
    "513": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear that your daughter is not feeling well. Diarrhea following antibiotic use is common, due to alterations in the gut microflora. If your child is otherwise active and feeding well, it's usually not a cause for concern. However, if the diarrhea is causing dehydration, or is accompanied by blood or mucus, a fever, vomiting, a rash, or if your daughter is drowsy or irritable, you should seek urgent medical attention.\n\nIn general, it's important to keep your child well hydrated. Give her small amounts of fluids often, including breast milk and oral rehydration solutions (ORS). \n\nIn terms of diet, introduce small amounts of simple, bland foods when she is ready to eat again. Try options like rice, potatoes, and bananas. Avoid spicy, fatty, and sugary foods until her digestion has fully recovered.\n\nWhen it comes to medicines, some over-the-counter medications can worsen diarrhea or have serious side effects in young children, so it's best to check with a healthcare provider before giving any new medications to your child.\n\nKeep in mind that viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu), one of the most common causes of diarrhea, needs to run its course and typically improves on its own within a week. If the diarrhea doesn't improve, lasts longer than a week, or is accompanied by other concerning symptoms, you should definitely have your daughter re-evaluated by her doctor.",
    "514": "These symptoms could suggest a neurological or cognitive disorder, such as early-onset dementia or a neurological issue potentially affecting the frontal lobe of the brain. Conditions like this can affect memory, speech, mood, and the ability to carry out everyday tasks. However, there could also be other causes, such as mental health issues like depression. It's important that these symptoms are evaluated by a professional. I'd advise seeking a second opinion from a neurologist or a geriatrician skilled in diagnosing dementia. They may recommend more detailed cognitive and physical testing, blood tests, and possibly brain imaging like an MRI or CT scan to help identify the cause of these changes. Remember, it's important to continue to communicate about your observations and concerns to the healthcare providers evaluating your father.",
    "515": "I'm sorry to hear you're feeling so unwell. Hashimoto's and salivary gland stones can indeed cause unpleasant symptoms, and it seems you're dealing with a potential viral infection as well. Antibiotics are not typically effective against viruses, which may be why your doctor did not prescribe them. However, given the persistence and progression of your symptoms, it would be advisable to seek medical attention again. It's possible that you've developed a bacterial infection secondary to the initial viral infection, which could potentially benefit from treatment with appropriate antibiotics. \n\nAs for the choice of antibiotic, Penicillin and its derivatives are often used for infections of the throat and upper respiratory tract, but the appropriate antibiotic really depends on the type and location of the infection, and also on individual factors such as your personal medical history and potential allergies. \n\nWhile waiting for your appointment, make sure to rest, stay well-hydrated, and continue using Tylenol for pain and fever if they help. Warm compresses, as you've noticed, can also provide some relief for swollen glands. \n\nI hope you'll feel better soon. Your ongoing health issues certainly sound challenging, but with the right approach and careful management, it's certainly possible to get them under control.",
    "516": "Your liver enzyme levels are indeed increasing which could indicate some form of liver disease. These enzymes usually rise when there is injury or inflammation to the liver cells. Possible causes could be viral hepatitis, fatty liver disease, alcohol-induced liver disease, certain medications, or less commonly, autoimmune or genetic liver diseases.\n\nHowever, given that you do not have any symptoms, and that the sudden increase is within a short period of time, it would be a good idea to repeat the tests in a different laboratory to ensure the accuracy of the results.\n\nFurther investigation might be needed, like an abdominal ultrasound or additional blood tests to check for viral hepatitis, to understand better what could be causing the high liver enzymes. \n\nRegarding your Bilirubin levels, it is mildly elevated. It could be a condition called Gilbert's syndrome, a harmless genetic condition which can cause occasional increases in bilirubin levels. \n\nYou should definitely consult with your doctor or a hepatologist for a comprehensive evaluation and guidance based on these test results. Remember also to inform them about any medications or supplements you are currently taking, as these could influence the liver enzyme levels. \n\nMeanwhile, ensure to maintain a good diet, avoid alcohol, and perform regular exercise. Please consult with your doctor for accurate information.",
    "517": "As a professional doctor, I can understand your concerns and it's quite normal to seek assurance about the diagnosis. Based on your description, your husband has an opacity in his left lower lung zone which could be due to several causes, one of which is pneumonitis. Pneumonitis presents with an area of increased opacity on a chest X-ray due to inflammation of lung tissue. \n\nHowever, just an X-ray is not sufficient to prove a diagnosis. The doctor needs to correlate the imaging findings with your husband's clinical symptoms and overall health status. \n\nLevodropropizine is a type of cough suppressant, and it's used to reduce coughing. It doesn't necessarily treat the root cause of the problem. If the pneumonitis is due to an infection, antibiotics may be required. If it's due to an allergen or irritant exposure, removal of the irritant is essential.\n\nIf your husband's symptoms don't clear up or if they get worse, I would recommend further investigations like CT Scan for a more detailed view of the lungs, and possibly bronchoscopy or biopsy if needed.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have regular follow-ups with your doctor so that he can monitor your husband's progress.",

It's an infection that can develop in people who have strep throat, and is characterized by a bright red rash on the body, sore throat, fever, and a \"strawberry\" (red with swollen taste buds) tongue. It's treatable with antibiotics, and it's important to contact a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and treatment to avoid possible complications. Additionally, maintaining a good oral hygiene can help soothe her painful tongue. Let her drink plenty of fluids and avoid spicy or acidic foods until her tongue heals. If she continues to experience pain or if her symptoms worsen, take her to a healthcare provider.",
    "519": "I'm sorry to hear you've been so unwell. Based on your description, it sounds like you may have experienced a post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) following the steroid injections. The good news is that the blood patch usually resolves PDPH, but in some cases, symptoms can still persist even after the procedure as it seems like in your case. Dural enhancement on MRI further hints towards irritation of the dura, which may still be causing your symptoms. \n\nThere can be other reasons for persistent headaches too, such as rebound headaches caused by overuse of painkillers, and it's important to rule these out. There are also conditions that can cause both dizziness and headaches, like migraines or certain types of inner ear disorders.\n\nAt this point, further investigation is needed to address your ongoing symptoms, review your medication list and possibly start a different pain regimen. You should consider a referral to a neurologist who specializes in headaches. Other treatments can be considered such as greater occipital nerve block or sphenopalatine ganglion block which have shown efficacy in such cases. \n\nI hope this information has been helpful and that you can find the relief you need soon.",
    "520": "Hello. I'm sorry to hear about your discomfort. It sounds like you are dealing with a persistent yeast infection and a potential urinary tract infection (from the tears and burning). The treatment you've incurred so far might not have been sufficient. For the yeast infection, it's usually necessary to take multiple doses of Diflucan (fluconazole), not just a single dose.\n\nYou may apply mild topical creams in the short term for relief from the burning. A cream containing Zinc oxide or a similar barrier cream could help limit contact with urine. Always clean the area before applying cream. \n\nA liquid bandage may not be helpful in this case since it may trap moisture and the burning sensation might get aggravated. So better to avoid that.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately to assess your symptoms to prevent the situation from getting worse. An antibiotic will likely be needed to treat any potential urinary tract infection and additional treatment for the yeast infection may be necessary as well. \n\nRemember, over the counter remedies can alleviate symptoms, but it is important to address the root cause to prevent a recurrence. You should contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible for an evaluation. \n\nIn the meantime, drink plenty of water to dilute your urine, which can help to reduce the burning sensation when urinating. Avoid wearing tight clothing or underwear and use 100% cotton underwear to improve ventilation in the area. Avoid soaps, shower gels, or other products with perfumes or",
    "521": "Hello, the symptoms you're experiencing, such as shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and muscle cramps, may be related to a variety of conditions and it's crucial to get them checked out by a healthcare professional. They could be a sign of cardiovascular issues, such as heart disease or congestive heart failure, especially given the combination of lightheadedness and shortness of breath. \n\nOther possible conditions include lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis. Dehydration or electrolyte imbalances can also cause muscle cramping. I would recommend you see a doctor as soon as possible for further evaluation. They may perform tests such as an ECG, stress test, or chest X-ray, to rule out or confirm cardiac or pulmonary diseases. \n\nPlease remember that while I am making suggestions based on the symptoms you've described, you should reach out to a healthcare provider who can assess your condition accurately.",
    "522": "Hello, from your description, it sounds like you may be experiencing what's known as heart palpitations, which are feelings of your heart racing, pounding, or skipping a beat. Occasional palpitations are usually harmless and can be brought on by certain things such as anxiety, stress, exercise, or certain medications like those containing caffeine. However, if the palpitations persist or are associated with other symptoms like dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath etc, it could indicate an underlying heart condition like arrhythmia.  Since you've had no history of heart problems and you don't have alarming symptoms, it's possible these palpitations are harmless. However, considering your age and the consistent palpitations, I'd recommend you see your doctor to rule out any potential heart conditions. A simple, painless test, such as a heart monitor or ECG, can give a lot of information about your heart rhythm.",
    "523": "I'm sorry to hear that you're having a tough time with your blood pressure. It's normal for your blood pressure and heart rate to rise with exertion, but if it's going too high, this suggests that your body is having to work harder than usual which might indicate that the heart isn't pumping efficiently. Or it may suggest that your medications aren't quite keeping up with the demand. Your feeling of passing out when at rest might be due to your blood pressure falling too low, which again could be a medication issue. \n\nThis could be a complex situation requiring detailed evaluation and balance of medications. It could be worth asking your doctor if any of your current medications need adjusting and whether additional tests, such as a stress test or Holter monitor, could be beneficial. Additionally, certain lifestyle measures like limiting salt intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and following a balanced diet can also help assist in managing your blood pressure.",
    "524": "Hello John, \n\nI'm sorry to hear that you've been going through this. Given your history with follicular lymphoma, it's understandable that you are worried. However, it's likely that the lump on your elbow is a hematoma (a collection of blood) or a contusion caused by the fall. The cough and cold are probably unrelated to the lump and could be due to a regular upper respiratory infection which are quite common. \n\nHowever, I would still recommend seeing your doctor because of your health history and your age. Even if these turn out to be unrelated to your lymphoma, your doctor should still be made aware of these recent developments. They may want to investigate the lump further or give you something for your cough and cold, especially since it's been over 10 days. \n\nPlease schedule an appointment with your doctor and continue monitoring your condition. If the lump gets larger or the cough and cold worsens, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nRemember that it's better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. You're doing a great job by reaching out and seeking advice. \n\nPlease take care and stay safe, John.",
    "525": "Hi,\n\nTo answer your first query: The presence of blood in the stool could be due to several circumstances ranging from minor issues like hemorrhoids (piles) or anal fissures to more serious conditions like gastrointestinal ulcers or even colorectal cancer. Given your symptoms of severe back pain and faintness along with this, it's essential that you visit a gastroenterologist for an examination and potentially a colonoscopy or fecal occult blood test to investigate further.\n\nYour second query: An \"annular laxity\" refers to looseness or instability in the annulus fibrosus, the tough outer layer of the intervertebral discs that sit between your spinal vertebrae. This laxity can lead to increased mobility of the involved vertebrae, potentially causing back pain or other symptoms. The mentioned degenerative changes are likely related to this laxity and suggest that the disc structure and function is deteriorating, often a common process of aging or strain on the spine.\n\nRegarding your third query: Building bone density, particularly in terms of osteoporosis, involves both adequate nutrition and appropriate exercise. Ensure that your diet is rich in calcium and vitamin D (or take supplements as directed by your doctor) as these are critical to bone health. Weight-bearing exercises such as walking, running, or resistance training can also be effective. You should also discuss with your doctor about potential medication options, such as bisphosphonates, that can help increase bone mass and reduce the risk of fractures.\n\n",
    "526": "I'm very sorry to hear about your husband's situation. It's quite challenging to assess someone's prognosis after a stroke and subdural hematoma as each case is unique. Generally, recovery involves a multi-disciplinary approach and takes time as brain recovery is a slow process, often weeks to months and even years in some cases. How complete the recovery will be depends on the severity of damage to brain tissues and how much rehabilitation is done. The tracheostomy is done so that his breathing is maintained while his brain heals.\n\nBrain stem stroke often affects many body functions because the brain stem is the control centre for most of what our body does automatically. If the stroke has affected vision centres in the brain, visual disturbances may occur. Complete recovery can never be guaranteed but with younger patients, their bodies are often more capable of healing from the damage.\n\nEach patient's journey in recovery is unique, and it may be beneficial to discuss his specific case with his neurologist since they would have a much better understanding of his particular situation. I hope this information is helpful, and I wish your husband a speedy recovery.",
    "527": "Hello, thanks for reaching out. Based on your description, it does appear that you have insect bites- whether they are from mosquitoes, bed bugs, other insects, or even exposure to plants (like poison ivy) from the grass area is hard to determine without looking at the bites. Both mosquito and bed bug bites are often red, swollen, itchy, and tend to become more apparent a few hours or even a day after the bite. Bed bug bites often appear in a linear fashion, typically on areas exposed while you are sleeping. Mosquito bites, on the other hand, could be anywhere on the body and may not follow any pattern. Taking an antihistamine can help with the itching, and applying a cold pack can help with the swelling. Keep the area clean to prevent infection. If the condition doesn't get better in a few days, or if it gets worse (redder, itchier, painful, oozing), I suggest getting checked by a healthcare professional.",
    "528": "Hello, what you're experiencing could be anxiety or panic attacks which can cause symptoms like an elevated heart rate, difficulty breathing, and feeling unstable or dizzy. However, it's also important to rule out any other potential physical causes like heart or thyroid disorders. Given your recent changes in reproductive hormones (from stopping breastfeeding), hormonal fluctuations could also potentially contribute to your symptoms. I would suggest speaking to your healthcare provider about the symptoms you are experiencing. They may wish to run some tests, like thyroid function tests, a basic metabolic panel, anemia evaluation, and possibly an EKG to check your heart rhythm. With all medical concerns, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider, who can take into consideration your individual health history and current symptoms.",
    "529": "Your symptoms certainly suggest a possible allergic reaction. It can be difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without a detailed exploration, which takes into account your medical history, lifestyle, and new elements that have been introduced to your environment or habits.\n\nYour suspicion that using an e-cigarette could be causing an allergic reaction isn't entirely unlikely. While nicotine can lead to dry skin and hypersensitivity reactions, your mention of propylene glycol (PG) as an ingredient is interesting. PG, often used as a base in vape liquids, can certainly cause allergic reactions in some individuals. Symptoms can include skin irritation, rashes, and dryness.\n\nThat being said, the swelling and rash these allergic reactions often cause can also resemble the negative effects of various other substances or health conditions.\n\nIt's great that you stopped using your e-cigarette. Please also consider taking an over-the-counter antihistamine to help relieve your symptoms and applying a mild, fragrance-free moisturizer to soothe your dry skin. If the symptoms persist beyond 48 hours of discontinuing your e-cigarette use, or if they worsen at any point, I recommend you visit a healthcare provider, who may refer you to an allergist or dermatologist for further testing and treatment.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that this advice is based on the limited details you've provided and is informative rather than definitive.

However, they can also be a symptom of anxiety. Given that you have a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, it's possible that anxiety is contributing to the shaking in your hand. I'd recommend that you start by seeing your GP or primary care provider. They can help determine whether the tremor is likely anxiety-related or if you should see a neurologist for further evaluation. Cognitive behavior therapy and medications like beta blockers or anti-anxiety drugs can be used to manage the symptoms. But it's essential to discuss with your doctor and find the root cause.

    "531": "Hello Alan, \n\nGiven your symptoms, it does sounds like lumbar nerve compression (also known as Sciatica) due to various reasons like a herniated disk, spinal stenosis or bone spurs. This usually causes pain, numbness or tingling in the lower back that can spread to one or both legs.\n\nYou should consult a specialist such as a neurologist, orthopedic surgeon or interventional pain management specialist for further evaluation and management. An MRI scan may be needed to get a better understanding of your situation.\n\nIn terms of pain management, it's right that ibuprofen can lead to kidney complications, especially with long-term use, and it's also worth noting that people with diabetes are already at somewhat higher risk for such complications. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is generally safer for longer-term use and doesn't have the kidney risks associated with NSAIDs like ibuprofen.\n\nHowever, over-the-counter pain relievers often provide only temporary relief and are not ideal for chronic pain. Besides, these medications can also cause adverse effects if used inappropriately or for prolonged periods.\n\nAside medications, physical therapy might help increase your mobility and strengthen your lower back and leg muscles which often helps decrease pain. Surgical treatment can also be considered if the findings on MRI confirm nerve compression and conservative management fails to alleviate the symptoms.\n\nAlways remember that it's best to have a thorough evaluation and medical consultation before starting or stopping any medications.",

It's also very important to keep an eye on the spread of redness or swelling, as it can indicate that the infection is spreading. If your finger continues to hurt or the infection appears to spread (redness, pus, increase in pain or swelling, fever), please seek immediate medical attention. They may need to drain the abscess or prescribe antibiotics. Also, ensure your tetanus vaccination is up-to-date as cuts and scrapes can sometimes lead to tetanus.",
    "533": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your recent health concerns. Regarding your diagnosis with basal cell carcinoma on your eyelid, it might be unrelated to the chemo splash. Basal cell carcinoma is usually caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or from tanning beds. However, if you believe you've been exposed to chemotherapy drugs outside of their contained environment, it's important to address your concern about the safety of your work environment with your employer or the occupational health and safety department.\n\nAs for cysts on your liver and kidneys, they could be simple cysts which are fairly common and often don't cause symptoms or need treatment. If you are experiencing symptoms or if they were discovered due to symptoms you were having, it's crucial to follow up with your doctor for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nTo protect your health on the job, be sure you're following recommended safety procedures when handling chemotherapy drugs, and use personal protective equipment at all times. If you're concerned about ventilation in your work area, also share these concerns with the appropriate department in your facility. Your health and safety should always be a top priority.",
    "534": "Hello! The blood pressure values you are mentioning fall within acceptable limits, especially if you do not have any symptoms. But the fluctuations do appear significant. Although, some momentary variations in blood pressure are normal depending on our activities but marked fluctuations should be checked out. A normal blood pressure category falls within a range of 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg. However, keep in mind that regular exercise, a balanced diet, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can also significantly affect blood pressure. Please keep monitoring your blood pressure and if the figures drop further and/or you feel symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, or weakness don't hesitate to get in touch with your healthcare provider.

    "535": "Hello Anji, \n\nIf you have a history of blood clots in your leg and are experiencing pain in your both legs, notably the one that previously had the clot, I would recommend seeking medical attention urgently. Blood clots in the leg can be very serious - if they detach and travel to the lungs, this can potentially lead to a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Given your long drive and minimal rest, it is important to evaluate this.\n\nIn the meantime, try not to massage the area as if there is a blood clot present, massaging could cause it to dislodge. Try to elevate your legs when lying down to improve blood flow. \n\nHowever, it's important to understand that nothing replaces a face-to-face evaluation with a doctor. Make sure to contact your healthcare provider immediately.",
    "536": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. I can understand your concerns regarding your skin allergy and taking Wysolone (prednisolone). It's true that Wysolone is a steroid medication and long-term use can have side effects. However, your doctor has prescribed a short course of this medication to reduce the inflammation and itching caused by your skin condition. \n\nIt is important to follow your doctor's instructions as medications like Wysolone can be very effective in treating acute flare-ups of skin conditions. The short term use is less likely to cause serious side effects. Regarding the Levocet, it is an antihistamine which will also help to reduce itching and is usually well-tolerated.\n\nRemember, not treating an aggressive allergic inflammation could also lead to complications. Therefore, my suggestion would be to follow your doctor's advice and take the medication as prescribed. And always report if you notice any unusual side effects.",
    "537": "Hello,\n\nI would not recommend adjusting your insulin dose on your own without first speaking to your healthcare provider. Taking an extra dose of insulin without professional guidance can potentially cause your blood sugar level to go too low, resulting in hypoglycemia, which can be dangerous.\n\nWhen you're facing elevated blood glucose, the best initial approach is to consider what lifestyle factors could be contributing — such as dietary choices, stress, lack of exercise, illness, or sleep disturbances — and try to address them as much as possible. \n\nAdditionally, it's helpful to note that consuming food during periods of insomnia can indeed cause blood glucose levels to be elevated, especially if these foods are higher in carbohydrates. It's important to try and manage your sleep patterns and minimize eating during the night as much as possible.\n\nPlease reach out to your healthcare provider as soon as possible to discuss your elevated glucose levels and your current situation with insomnia. They can guide you on the best and safest course of action. Stay safe!",
    "538": "I understand your concerns. Have you discussed this with her cardiologist? Your mother's condition makes travel more risky, definitely. Depending on how far the trip is, it could add a fair amount of stress to her system. You would want to ensure that she's stable before considering travel. \n\nGiven her condition, fatigue and shortness of breath are expected symptoms. The wheezing could potentially be due to fluid build up in her lungs from her heart failure or possibly even due to a touch of asthma. \n\nIdeally, if it has been decided for her to travel, it would be best that she have a wheelchair service for all transport within airports if flying is involved. Try to limit the amount of physical activity required as much as possible and ensure prompt access to medical care throughout the trip. Pack a sufficient supply of all her medications and a copy of her latest medical summary in case of emergency. \n\nPlease note that these are general advice and recommendations, the ultimate decision should be only taken after her cardiologist has been consulted and has deemed the travel safe.",
    "539": "Hi, I understand both your and your son's concerns. On the day of the appointment, the doctor will likely start by asking some questions about your son's symptoms such as how long they've been present, if the pain is constant or intermittent, and if there were any injuries or activities that might have caused the pain. \n\nThe doctor will then proceed to do a physical examination. This will involve your son lying down on an examination table, and then the doctor will gently feel the structures of the scrotum through gloves. \n\nThis exam is to check for any lumps, swelling, tenderness, or abnormalities in the testicles and surrounding areas. It's important to note that this might be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. They might also shine a light through the scrotum to check for possible fluid collection.\n\nThey may also examine other areas such as the abdomen, as issues in the groin or stomach can sometimes cause testicular pain.\n\nBased on the findings, the doctor may suggest an ultrasound of the scrotum for further investigation, which is a completely painless process.\n\nThroughout the process, the doctor will explain each step to your son and you can be present with him if he's comfortable with it, to provide additional reassurance.\n\nRemember, it’s good that you have made an appointment for your son, as any testicular pain needs to be evaluated by a physician. Don’t hesitate to ask any other questions you might have – it’s important for both",
    "540": "Hi there. This could be a number of things. It could be that you are experiencing something called palpitations, which feel like your heart is beating harder or faster than usual. Often, these can feel like flutters in the chest. This can be caused by things like stress, anxiety, certain medications, caffeine, and sometimes by heart conditions. \n\nHowever, in the absence of any other symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, feeling faint, etc., it may also be due to non-heart-related causes such as gas or muscle spasms.\n\nI would recommend, given this has been going on for a couple of days now, that you make an appointment with your healthcare provider. They can do a proper evaluation and, if needed, refer you to a specialist such as a cardiologist. Please don't ignore these symptoms. Even though it might not be a heart problem, whatever is causing the sensations needs to be investigated.\n\nMeanwhile, try to avoid common triggers like caffeine, alcohol, and stress, and monitor your symptoms. Document when they occur, how long they last, and if anything specific triggers them. This information can be very helpful for your doctor.\n\nRemember this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information.\n",
    "541": "Hi, thank you for your question. I would strongly advise against trying to pop any lumps or bumps in this area as it could potentially lead to infection or other complications. It could potentially be a number of things, ranging from something simple like a sebaceous cyst or ingrown hair to something more serious like a hernia or hydrocele. It's hard to say exactly without a physical examination. Even if it's not causing pain, a new lump in the testicle area should always be checked out by a doctor to rule out anything serious, especially if it appeared suddenly. Please make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible. It's probably nothing to worry about, but it's best to be safe.",
    "542": "Hi, an occasional finding of 1-3 pus cells/hpf in a stool sample may not be concerning as it may occur due to inflammation or irritation in the intestines. The presence of few fat globules might indicate that your son is not fully digesting the fats in his diet. The fact that no parasite is seen means that the amoeba, which was earlier diagnosed, is likely treated with the medication you mentioned.\n\nFrequent bowel movements can sometimes be normal, especially in children his age, but if the stool is loose, watery, or if you notice signs of dehydration (like dry lips, sunken eyes, decreased urination, or lethargy), or if he's not gaining weight normally, these could be signs of a problem.\n\nIt would be a good idea to discuss these findings and your son's symptoms with his pediatrician. Sometimes, the inflammation caused by an infection can persist for a while, leading to continued symptoms even after the infection is treated. The doctor might suggest a period of dietary adjustment or further treatments if needed.",
    "543": "It sounds like your daughter is experiencing a bout of gastroenteritis, which is inflammation of the stomach and intestines, usually due to a bacterial or viral infection. Symptoms often include diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, fever, and chills. \n\nMost cases of gastroenteritis are mild and resolve on their own within a few days. The most important thing is to ensure she stays hydrated. Give her plenty of fluids such as water, broth or oral rehydration solutions. Avoid spicy and hard-to-digest foods for a few days.\n\nIf her symptoms don't improve after 2-3 days, if she is unable to keep fluids down due to vomiting, if her diarrhea is severe or bloody, or if she develops a high fever or severe abdominal pain, she should seek medical attention immediately. These could be signs of a more serious condition such as appendicitis or a severe infection.\n\nPlease also remember to encourage her to wash her hands regularly to avoid spreading the infection to others. It's also key to remember that this advice is based on the symptoms presented, and it's always important to consult with a doctor or medical professional for an accurate diagnosis.",
    "544": "I'm sorry to hear about your recent fall and the ongoing issues with dizziness. Based on your description, it seems this could potentially be related to your acoustic neuroma, especially considering that you become dizzy when moving your head in certain positions. Dizziness is a common symptom associated with acoustic neuromas as they often affect the inner ear's balance mechanisms. \n\nHowever, it is also possible that the fall itself, especially if there was a head injury involved, could have caused some ongoing issues with balance or dizziness. \n\nThe medication Meclizine is commonly used to help reduce symptoms of dizziness and vertigo, so it is a reasonable treatment to try in your case. However, considering your past history with an acoustic neuroma and the relatively recent onset of these symptoms, it might be necessary to have another evaluation to assess whether the tumor has grown or changed in any way, as this could potentially require different treatment. \n\nAs with any health concerns, it's always best to continue communicating openly with your treating physician about your symptoms and any changes you notice. They will be able to help you determine the best next steps based on your specific medical history and current condition.",
    "545": "Hi, I understand your concern. Your symptoms which have persisted since your pregnancy could be signs of peripheral neuropathy, which can cause tingling and numbness in hands and feet, however, this would have been picked up on the nerve conduction studies. Meanwhile, your \"skippy heart\" feeling and feelings of panic might be due to anxiety or possibly an arrhythmia. A 24 hour Holter monitor could help to diagnose an arrhythmic issue if it exists.\n\nBecause you have a family history of diabetes, it's important to rule this out as a cause of your symptoms. I would suggest getting your fasting sugar, HBA1c and postprandial sugar levels checked. \n\nFurthermore, adding regular exercises and yoga to your routine may help with your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is also an effective treatment modality for anxiety that you might want to consider. Look into sessions with a licensed therapist who specializes in this type of therapy. It's very results oriented. \n\nPlease discuss these concerns with your doctor during your upcoming appointment.stay in touch with your doctor, and continue appointments to monitor your condition.",
    "546": "I'm sorry to hear about your pain. Your MRI results suggest that you have a degenerative condition of the spine called Lumbar Spondylosis. The disc bulges are pressing on the nerves that are exiting from your spine (foraminal narrowing) and this is most likely the cause of your sciatic pain.\n\nInitial treatment usually starts with conservative approaches such as physical therapy or chiropractic care focusing to improve core muscle strength, spinal flexibility and posture. Pain medications or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be prescribed to manage the pain. Steroid injections could be considered if the pain is severe and isn’t improved with medications.\n\nHowever, if these interventions don't work or if the condition worsens, surgery might be an option. You should consult with a neurosurgeon or an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation. They can provide you with the best advice based on a complete medical evaluation.\n\nI would also suggest lifestyle modifications, including maintaining a healthy weight, regular physical activity and proper body mechanics (avoiding heavy lifting, maintaining good posture, choosing a supportive mattress and chair, etc.)\n\nRemember each patient is unique and treatment can vary based on individual circumstance, health status, level of activity and pain tolerance.

From what you described, it could be something like a lipoma (a benign fatty tissue growth) or a hernia, particularly if the lump is more noticeable when you cough or strain. However, it could also be a cyst or a swollen lymph node, depending on the specific characteristics of the lump. The fact that your lower back is hurting may or may not be related. You should schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider who can examine the lump and determine what it may be. Imaging studies like an ultrasound might be needed for further evaluation. If the lump grows, becomes more painful, or if you develop other symptoms, seek medical attention promptly.",

The symptoms you describe could be consistent with eczema, but could also suggest a skin infection, such as cellulitis or abscess formation, especially considering you mention pus from the area. You could also have a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa, where sweat glands get blocked and cause painful nodules and scarring. \n\nTo manage this at home, keep the area clean and dry, you can apply a warm compress to alleviate the pain and use an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment if there is an open sore. \n\nHowever, for such persistent symptoms, it's very important that you see a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. They may prescribe an antibiotic or topical ointment to help clear any infection and decrease inflammation. \n\nPlease do not delay seeking professional help. It's crucial to manage these symptoms promptly to prevent potential complications and worsening of the condition.",

It's important not to pop them as this can lead to further infection and scarring.\n\nWhile mild cases of folliculitis often improve with home care–warm compresses to the area, good hygiene, anti-itch creams, avoiding irritating the area–if the condition is getting worse, a visit to the doctor is necessary. They can provide antibiotic or antifungal treatments as needed. \n\nStress to your daughter that untreated skin conditions have the potential to get worse and cause long-term damage, including permanent scarring. This isn't something to take lightly, even though I understand she might be uncomfortable going to the doctor. Managing to overcome the resistance is very important for her well-being in this situation.",
    "550": "Given your description of the injury and the subsequent symptoms, it's possible that the injury may have impacted your left kidney or the surrounding tissues. It's not completely unusual for some symptoms, such as pain or tenderness, to become more predominate as the initial shock of the injury wears off. The increased urination may be related or it might be coincidental, it's hard to say for certain without a physical examination and potentially some imaging or lab tests. \n\nIt's important that you see a physician as soon as possible. If there is an injury to the kidney, there's a risk of internal bleeding - while your symptoms don't strongly suggest this, it would be the major concern. If the injury is to surrounding tissues - muscle or connective tissue, for instance - there is also an increased risk of infection because of the open wound. Either way, these symptoms warrant a quick medical evaluation. \n\nPlease seek medical attention immediately, especially as the pain is worsening and you're having other symptoms like increased urination. Without an examination and potentially some medical tests, it's hard to say exactly what's going on.",

It's crucial to maintain a consistent thyroid hormone level in your body and not to stop your thyroid medication without consulting with your doctor.\n\nBefore planning for conception, I recommend controlling your thyroid function, optimizing your weight and making sure that the periods are regular. Washing or cleaning the uterus is not usually required unless there is a specific reason for it, such as an infection or polyps.\n\nIt's advisable to consult your doctor for a preconception checkup. In this checkup, your doctor will evaluate your health and identify any potential risks that could affect your pregnancy. In your case, having your thyroid function tested and managing it properly should be a priority.\n\nOverall, please remember to consult with your health care provider before stopping or changing any medication.",
    "552": "The symptoms you're describing could potentially be due to a few different causes. It could be a muscle strain or sprain from your work posture or other physical activities. The lump could be a swollen lymph node or a cyst. However, given the severity of the symptoms and that they're not resolving, it's important to seek medical attention. Working all day on a computer can certainly contribute to tension in the neck, and using an ergonomic chair and taking regular breaks to stretch can help prevent neck pain/stiffness.\n\nKeep in mind that especially in the case of a lump, it's really important to have these changes evaluated in person by a healthcare provider. They can perform a physical exam and order any necessary imaging or tests to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. While it's not possible to say for sure without seeing you, edema (swelling caused by fluid buildup in tissues), wouldn't typically cause a lump in one specific area. \n\nIt's also worth noting that sudden weight gain can be a sign of a number of different health conditions, so be sure to mention this to your healthcare provider as well. Additionally, they can provide guidance about any necessary lifestyle changes or treatments to help manage your weight.\n\nWhile waiting for your doctor's appointment, over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen may provide some temporary relief from pain and inflammation, but it's important to use these as directed and not for an extended period of time. \n\nAs always, if you have",

Metronidazole is an antibiotic, and it might have been prescribed as a precautionary measure to prevent any potential infection, rather than for the hematoma itself. \n\nHematomas typically improve over a period of a few weeks as your body slowly reabsorbs the blood. Applying a warm compress can help to speed up this process. If the lump starts to increase in size, becomes more painful, or you develop a fever, that might indicate an infection, and you should seek medical attention immediately.\n\nDoctors have no reason to lie to you about this.

I'm glad that you are going to see a doctor as it is critical to get a definitive diagnosis. Please make sure to describe all your symptoms as accurately as possible so your doctor can make the most informed diagnosis. \n\nIn the meantime, rinsing your mouth with mild salt water may help soothe some of your symptoms.

Given your ongoing symptoms and the tenderness of the lymph nodes, it seems like there may be an ongoing infection or inflammation, potentially related to chronic sinusitis or allergies. It's normal for lymph nodes to swell in response to infection or inflammation as they help your body fight off illness. That being said, if your symptoms have been persisting for over three months, it’s worth following up with your doctor again. She might want to reassess and potentially opt for more diagnostic procedures, such as blood tests, an ultrasound or even a biopsy of the lymph node if felt necessary. Try to avoid poking or palpating the lymph nodes repeatedly, as this can itself cause them to remain enlarged.

    "568": "Hello, thank you for trusting Chat Doctor and sharing your concern. It's important to understand that an ultrasound report alone cannot confirm a diagnosis of cancer. The radiologist's note about a possible blood clot or endometrial irregularity merely means that the appearance is not typical, and could represent a number of possibilities. At your age, thickening of the endometrium could be due to a number of benign causes like polyps, fibroids, or hormonal changes. However, considering your age and the presence of an irregular mass, further investigation would be recommended to rule out endometrial cancer. This usually involves an endometrial biopsy or a hysteroscopy, where a small sample of endometrium is collected and examined under a microscope. Please consult with your gynecologist about the next steps. This should not necessarily be viewed as alarming, but it is important to be proactive in order to promptly diagnose and treat any potential issues. Take care!",

Irritation, redness, rashes, and even sores can occur due to the use of hair removal creams such as Veet, especially in the sensitive genital region. The symptoms you describe are most likely an irritant contact dermatitis caused by the product. This is not typically serious but can be very uncomfortable and distressing. \n\nInitially I advise rinsing the area thoroughly with cool water if you haven't yet done so. Afterwards, apply an over-the-counter topical hydrocortisone cream on the inflamed area twice daily. This will help to reduce inflammation and discomfort. If you have an emollient cream such as petroleum jelly, apply this to the area after the hydrocortisone to protect and soothe the skin. Do not apply any perfumed products, wear cotton underwear, and avoid friction as much as possible in the area to prevent additional irritation.\n\nIn case the pain and inflammation do not improve in a few days, or if you experience increasing pain, fever, or signs of infection such as yellow pus or significantly increased redness or swelling, I would strongly recommend you to see a healthcare provider for proper examination and treatment. \n\nRemember, it's best to avoid using these types of products on your genital area in the future. I hope this helps and that you feel better soon.",
    "570": "Hi. It sounds like your son may have impetigo, a common and highly contagious skin infection that children can get. Impetigo usually appears as red sores on the face, especially around the nose and mouth, and on the hands and feet. The sores burst and develop honey-colored crusts. If your son's infection is affecting the eye area, it's extremely important to have him seen by a doctor as soon as possible to avoid potential complications. While in most cases, impetigo can be treated with a course of antibiotics, more serious cases may require further medical intervention. I suggest you reach out to his pediatrician right away.  \n",
    "571": "If the lump you're feeling is hard, round, movable, and has not changed in size, it might likely be a lipoma (a non-cancerous lump of fatty tissue) or some kind of hernia. It's not common for gallbladders to become large enough to palpate through your abdominal wall, and if it were symptomatic (like gallstones) you'd likely be experiencing intense pain. \n\nHowever, given your weight, it's also important to consider the risk of having a liver condition. The liver's edge can sometimes be felt below the ribs on the right side, especially in overweight people. So if it feels like it's attached to the ribs, it might be your liver.\n\nWhile it's quite unlikely for this to be a medical emergency, it's always best to get it checked out as soon as reasonably possible, especially if you notice any changes. But if you're not experiencing any other symptoms like severe pain, nausea, vomiting, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and the lump doesn't become suddenly larger or painful, waiting until your insurance renews within a few weeks should not pose a significant risk.\n  \nKeep in mind though, this advice is based on the limited information provided and can't replace a thorough evaluation by your healthcare provider. If you develop any concerning symptoms before your insurance renews, do seek immediate medical attention.",
    "572": "Hello, and thank you for your question. Nerve pain can be a result of several different conditions. Depending on the severity of the condition, surgery may or may not be necessary. Generally speaking, surgery is often the last resort after all other treatments options have been exhausted and are not providing relief.\n\nNerve pain in the leg could potentially be due to a condition called sciatica, which is caused by irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve. Available treatments for this condition range from physical therapy, medications to ease the pain (like NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, or even antidepressants), and in severe cases, surgery to relieve the pressure on the nerve.\n\nIf your father has been recommended surgery, it could be due to the severity of his condition. Perhaps the nerve is extremely compressed or damaged, which is causing him a lot of pain. \n\nHowever, if you are unsure about surgery, there is no harm in seeking a second opinion from another healthcare provider. It might be also beneficial to ask about non-surgical treatment options and see if any of those can be tried before moving forward with an operation.\n\nRemember, the decision to have surgery should be made after clear understanding of the benefits and potential risks associated with the procedure. Your father's overall health, age, and personal preferences should also factor into this decision.",
    "573": "Hello. Viral fever itself usually resolves within a week or so. Recurring fever could be a sign of a chronic underlying condition. If fever has been persistent for few months, then it is certainly not due to a simple viral fever. It could possibly be due to a persistence of infection in the kidney (if there was one before), poor diabetes control or a new infection due to decreased immunity from diabetes. \n\nYour father's symptoms are consistent with infection, and don't necessarily suggest cancer. Nevertheless, he needs a detailed examination and further investigation. This would typically include complete blood counts, chest x-ray, urine and kidney function tests, and scans if required. Please consult a local physician for these tests and further management.\n\nMaintaining good blood sugar control, a balanced diet and good hydration will definitely aid in his recovery and overall health.",
    "574": "Hello, I understand your concern. The two prominent possibilities your doctors have pointed out, which are colon problems and ovarian cysts, cannot be ruled out based only on symptoms and thus need further examination and testing. However, it should be noted that contraceptives like Sprintec generally don't cause that kind of persistent abdominal pain. They can lead to some abdominal discomfort or mild cramps but these symptoms usually subside within first few months of using the contraceptive. If the pain has become severe, it warrants further investigation. I strongly recommend you consult with a gastroenterologist for the potential colon issue and a gynaecologist for the possiblity of ovarian cysts. In both cases, imaging tests such as an ultrasound or even an MRI may be required for better examination. Please don't ignore these symptoms and reach out to healthcare professionals.",
    "575": "Hello, while it's hard to determine the exact reason why your husband's Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) levels are increasing without doing a physical examination or knowing his medical history, it's possible that it could be due to his liver condition. The liver releases ALP into the bloodstream, and levels of this enzyme can rise in response to liver inflammation or damage.\n\nHowever, high ALP levels can be associated with other conditions as well, including bone diseases or certain gastrointestinal conditions. The rise in ALP level corresponds with the elevated triglycerides and LDL (bad cholesterol) and confirms the liver stress due to fatty liver and high cholesterol.\n\nTherefore, his doctors will likely perform further tests, such as the abdominal echo you mentioned, to learn more about what's going on. Until then, maintain a healthy diet low in fats and cholesterol and do regular exercise.\n\nIt's important to follow your doctor's advice and to communicate your concerns with them, as they would be able to provide you with more precise medical advice based on the complete information available.",
    "576": "I'm sorry to hear about your husband's diagnosis. The soreness your husband is experiencing may not be directly related to his heart conditions, rather, it might be related to the muscles and bones of the chest wall. If he experiences pain due to his heart condition, it is most likely to manifest as chest pain, shortness of breath or fatigue, rather than soreness to touch. The most important thing is to follow the cardiologist's treatment plan closely, and to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences severe chest pain, difficulty breathing or fainting spells. These could signal an acute heart problem that needs immediate treatment. Of course, communication with the cardiologist about new or changing symptoms is crucial.",
    "577": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about the level of pain you're experiencing. It's important to try and figure out the cause behind it. Pain in the neck, shoulders and back of the head can often be due to muscle tension or strain, sometimes related to poor posture or activities like excessive computer use. However, it could also possibly be due to a nerve impingement or even cervical disc disease since the pain radiates downward.\n\nGiven the severity of the pain and the fact that it's interfering with your daily activities, it would be advisable to seek further medical evaluation. An MRI would give a detailed view of the soft tissues, including the spinal cord and nerves, and can help in determining if there is any nerve impingement or disc pathology that might be causing your symptoms. Prior to scanning, however, a physical examination by a physician, preferably a neurologist or an orthopedist, would be beneficial.\n\nIn the meantime, ensure you maintain a good posture, use a firm supportive pillow and avoid lifting heavy items or any activities that might exacerbate the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers may also help in reducing the symptoms. But remember, these are just temporary measures until the source of the pain is identified and treated appropriately. Don't hesitate to seek medical help urgently if your symptoms persist or worsen.",
    "578": "I'm sorry to hear about your struggle with acne. Acne can be a complex issue influenced by various factors such as genetics, hormonal changes, diet, stress, and skin type. Since over-the-counter treatments are not helping, you could consider some prescription treatments. However, also remember that maintaining a consistent skincare routine and a healthy lifestyle is crucial. Here's a basic routine you may follow:\n\n1. Gentle Cleansing: Use a gentle, non-drying cleanser twice a day. Avoid scrubbing your skin, as it might irritate your skin and make your acne worse.\n\n2. Toner: Use a toner that doesn't contain alcohol. Look for ingredients that can help control oil and unclog pores.\n\n3. Moisturize: Even if your skin is oily, do not skip this step. Use a non-comedogenic moisturizer to prevent your skin from producing extra oil.\n\n4. Sunscreen: Use a non-comedogenic, broad-spectrum sunscreen to prevent any acne marks from getting darker.\n\n5. Topical Medicines: Products that contain retinol or benzoyl peroxide can be helpful. Use them only as directed to avoid irritation.\n\n6. Eat Healthily: Your diet can impact your skin. Try to maintain a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.\n\nRemember, it's important to avoid squeezing or picking at your pimples, as this may lead to scarring. Also, changes in your skin will take time",

Both your total cholesterol and LDL ('bad cholesterol') need to be lower to decrease your risk of heart disease, especially considering your family history. Considerably high blood pressure levels can also increase the risk for heart disease and stroke. I recommend making an appointment with your healthcare provider as soon as possible. They can discuss a plan which may include changes in diet, increased exercise, and potentially medication to help manage your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In the meantime, try to reduce your intake of saturated fats and salt, maintain regular exercise and avoid tobacco and alcohol.",
    "581": "Hello Divya, it's unfortunate to hear that you're struggling with a persistent cough. A chronic cough can be caused by many things, such as postnasal drip, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), asthma, certain medications, chronic infections, and other conditions. Since your tests have been normal, it suggests that conventional causes for cough aren't revealing themselves, which can make treatment tricky. \n\nBecause you're experiencing this cough at night and it makes you feel like vomiting, it's possible that you may be dealing with GERD, where stomach acid can back up into your esophagus and cause coughing and a nauseous sensation. Additionally, GERD can cause symptoms that flare-up during the night and can disrupt sleep. \n\nWhile I recommend discussing the possibility of GERD with your doctor, you might find some relief by making lifestyle changes such as elevating the head of your bed, avoiding large meals or eating close to bedtime, avoiding trigger foods that can increase acid production (like spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, etc.), quitting smoking if you do, and losing weight if overweight.\n\nIf GERD isn't the cause, it's also plausible that your cough could be due to something environmental, in which case, an allergist may help to identify potential triggers. \n\nLastly, don't hesitate to seek a second opinion if you feel your current treatment isn't working - sometimes, fresh eyes can bring new perspective. Good luck and I hope you will feel better soon",
    "582": "Hello, I can understand your concern. It seems like your baby may have developed a birth cephalohematoma, which is a generally harmless condition caused by birthing trauma. However, a fall could potentially exacerbate this condition, so it's important to monitor your baby closely.\n\nAlso, to address your question, at this stage of infancy, babies' skulls are still soft and pliable, with \"fontanels,\" or soft spots, that allow for rapid brain growth. These soft spots can sometimes feel like dents or depressions. \n\nIt's reassuring that your baby is otherwise behaving normally and doesn't seem to be in any distress, which suggests any injury from the fall was most likely mild.\n\nHowever, I would advise that you make an appointment with your pediatrician soon to have this checked out, just to be on the safe side. They may want to see your baby to rule out any possible complications like a skull fracture or to confirm if it is indeed a cephalohematoma and not something more serious. Meanwhile, continue to monitor your baby for any changes in behavior, feeding patterns, or consciousness.\n\nMost importantly, accidents happen so try not to blame yourself too much.

In Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the platelets, which are cell fragments in your blood that help in clotting. Standard treatments involve corticosteroids, immune globulins, and in certain cases, platelet transfusions. \n\nWhen these treatments don't work or ITP is chronic, other medications like Eltrombopag and Romiplostim, which help stimulate the body to produce more platelets, are used. Other treatments like Rituximab, which your niece is currently receiving, helps lower the immune system's attack on platelets. There's also the method of surgery to remove the spleen (splenectomy), since the spleen is where platelet destruction often happens. \n\nHowever, each case is unique, and a specialist would be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan based on the health history of your niece, considering her age and overall health.

Hematuria, or blood in the urine, can be caused by a variety of conditions, not just kidney disease. These can include bladder or kidney infections, bladder or kidney stones, or more rarely tumors. A CT scan without contrast is generally a good test to evaluate for stones and more structural issues. If no cause was found on these tests, further evaluation with cystoscopy (a procedure to look inside the bladder) or a CT with contrast could be considered, if your providers think it is necessary based on their evaluation and your specific medical history. \n\nYour healthcare provider may also suggest a repeat urine test in some time to confirm if the blood in urine was incidental or is persisting.

The unevenness and asymmetry of your circumcision scar is mostly due to how the healing process occurred after your surgery. Every individual heals differently after a surgical procedure, dependent on many factors including skin type and genetics. \n\nThe stretch marks are likely caused by the natural growth and development of your penis over time. As for the uneven pigmentation, it's also a natural result of scarring and healing. \n\nIn terms of treatments, there are various options. Silicone sheets or gel can sometimes be effective at reducing the size and color of scars and are available over the counter.

While vitamin E is generally considered safe and is unlikely to result in an adverse reaction when applied to the skin, a few individuals might be hypersensitive to it, so you should test it on a small area first.\n\nTopical retinoid creams may also help with discoloration and potentially improve scar texture. However, these medications can irritate the skin and should be used under the supervision of a dermatologist.\n\nWhile these treatments may improve the appearance of your scar, they are unlikely to completely erase it.

Apply these immediately after a shower to lock in moisture.\n\nCerave SA Cream for rough and bumpy skin is often recommended and can be used along with physical exfoliators like exfoliating brushes or mitts to help remove dry skin patches.\n\nIf these methods have not been successful, you should consider visiting a dermatologist who may prescribe a higher-strength lotion. \n\nRemember, your skin may look clear when you use the cream, and become flaky when you stop because the skin condition is long-term, and consistent use of the cream will be necessary. Regular mild exfoliation will also be beneficial. \n\nMake sure to avoid harsh soaps or body washes that can strip your skin of its natural oils. Use gentle, hypoallergenic soaps or body washes.\n\nAlso note that exposure to the sun may make your condition worse,",

Long-term effects of acute pancreatitis if any, can be chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic insufficiency or diabetes, but these are not common especially if you had only one episode and it was managed correctly. Majority of people recover completely from acute pancreatitis and go back to normal life without long term complications.\n\nAbout your heart rate, an increased resting heart rate could be due to several factors like stress, anxiety, dehydration, or a side effect of some medication. Regular cardiovascular exercise actually helps to lower the resting heart rate but keep in mind certain medications or caffeine can increase the heart rate. If you find consistently elevated heart rate, it's best to consult with your primary care physician or a cardiologist to rule out any cardiovascular issues. A simple EKG and blood work can help in providing further insights. Keep on maintaining a healthy lifestyle as this helps in overall wellbeing.",

The treatment and prognosis would therefore depend on this cause. Some people find relief with methods such as noise suppression therapies or certain medications, but there unfortunately isn't a universal cure. It's important to continue working closely with your healthcare provider to manage your symptoms and explore potential treatments. As for the cost, it can vary widely depending on the services provided and the specific healthcare provider.

It certainly could be an allergic reaction, considering the timing of your symptoms along with the recent changes in your environment (new paint and carpet). These materials can sometimes emit volatile organic compounds, which could trigger allergies in some people. Your symptoms of itchy eyes, throat, and skin are all common symptoms of an allergic reaction.\n\nI would recommend taking some steps to alleviate your symptoms, such as using an air purifier to help clear out any potential allergens in your home. Over-the-counter antihistamines might also be helpful.\n\nIf these symptoms persist or worsen, then it would be a good idea to get evaluated by a healthcare provider.

This condition can occur without a specific injury and is often related to repetitive movements or overuse. Other symptoms can include pain, difficulty moving the wrist, reduced strength, and sometimes swelling or warmth.\n\nHowever, other conditions such as early arthritis or a ganglion cyst could also cause similar symptoms. It's important to get a proper diagnosis, as the treatment can vary depending on the underlying cause.

They may suggest an x-ray or MRI for further investigation if needed.\n\nIn the meantime, try to rest your wrist as much possible and try to avoid any movements that cause pain. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs and simple painkillers can help reduce pain and swelling. A wrist support brace can also provide some temporary relief.\n\nMost importantly, don't ignore this issue as it has been persistent for a few months. Left untreated, it can lead to chronic problems and potentially affect the function of your wrist. \n\nPlease keep me updated with your condition.

    "608": "Hi. Thanks for reaching out. It seems like the stringy substance that you are feeling could be part of the gauze or dissolvable stitches that are placed post-surgery, especially if you had a surgical extraction. However, bleeding 5 days post-extraction is not a typical occurrence. While it can be normal in smaller amounts, a steady stream of bleeding needs attention. Try biting down on a clean, damp cloth or gauze. If the bleeding doesn't stop, I would recommend you contact your dentist or oral surgeon right away. In the meantime, avoid any activity that could exacerbate the bleeding such as spitting, rinsing, smoking, or drinking from a straw.",
    "609": "Hello Kaye. Considering that you are asthmatic, and currently suffering from severe bronchitis with notable wheezing, it would be advisable to seek prompt medical attention. It's important to manage these asthma exacerbations early to avoid any possible complications. Even if your infection is viral, you may still require additional therapies like inhaled bronchodilators or possibly a short course of oral corticosteroids to manage your asthma symptoms. Additionally, if there is any concern that you may have a secondary bacterial infection, a course of antibiotics may be necessary. Please make sure to seek emergency care if you have shortness of breath.",
    "610": "Hi Jawed. Your symptoms suggest that you may have gastritis or a peptic ulcer - these can definitely cause upper abdominal pain. It is common to have such symptoms due to acidity or gastritis. As you mentioned, you're already taking medication (Happi-D),  which is a combination of Rabeprazole and Domperidone; it's a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces acid production in the stomach.\n\nAs far as your diet is concerned, milk can sometimes worsen the symptoms of acidity in some people. It varies from person to person. Instead of milk, try having a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and grains. Avoid spicy, fatty, and fried foods. Also, try to eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of three large ones.\n\nIf your symptoms persist, it's important to have a complete evaluation by a gastroenterologist to rule out other conditions, like gallbladder issues or pancreatitis. \n\nRemember that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate examinations, treatment, testing, and care recommendations.",

However, physical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, hormonal imbalances, or nerve damage could also be the cause.\n\nThe 'water' you mentioned is likely pre-ejaculate, a normal fluid that the body produces when sexually aroused. This does not typically interfere with erection or sexual activity.\n\nFor an effective treatment plan, it would be best to consult with a healthcare professional who can help identify any underlying issues, whether they are physical or psychological. They may suggest lifestyle modifications, psychological counselling, or medications, depending on the root cause of the problem.\n\nIn the meantime, try to reduce stress through relaxation methods such as meditation or yoga, maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and a balanced diet.

Even though you have started taking the treatment, it might take a few days to start seeing improvement. Don't worry, this is common. \n\nIn addition to the Eso Kit, your doctor might be able to prescribe a medication to help control the stomach acid and reduce the heartburn. An over-the-counter antacid might also be useful. However, it's important you communicate this symptom to your referring physician. If pain persists, an evaluation should be done to assess for ulcers which might be causing the heartburn. You should also try avoiding spicy foods, alcohol, caffeine and anything else that seems to worsen heartburn. \n\nRemember, for the Eso Kit to be effective, it's important that you finish the complete course of therapy, even if you start to feel better.

When the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) does not close properly and stomach contents leak back, or reflux, into the esophagus, this can cause heartburn and other symptoms. However, repeated vomiting can be due to many different conditions, so it's important to investigate further if this continues. It can be caused by gastric outlet obstruction, certain medicines, and gallbladder disease, among other causes.\n\nIn terms of what you're currently doing, continue taking your prescribed medication. Additionally, try to make lifestyle interventions .e.g., Avoid foods and drinks that trigger your heartburn (everyone’s triggers are different, but often include coffee, chocolate, foods with a lot of fat or oil, and alcoholic drinks), eat smaller meals more frequently throughout the day, avoid lying down too soon after eating – try to stay upright for at least 2 hours\nIf you're still not finding relief after these changes, please let me know and we can explore other treatment options.",
    "614": "I'm sorry to hear about your sister's ongoing health issues. It sounds like she's having a lot of discomfort. The hand tightening you're describing could be a condition called hepatic myopathy, or could also be due to an electrolyte imbalance. \n\nThe \"lumpy and mushy\" feeling in her right calf is likely due to edema or excess fluid retention, possibly caused by her liver disease and ascites. With severe edema, pressure can leave a dent in the skin - this is known as \"pitting edema\". \n\nBoth of these symptoms suggest that her body is having difficulty managing fluids, and could be indicative of her liver disease progressing. It's important to share these new symptoms with her healthcare provider, who can adjust her treatment plan accordingly. \n\nThey might make changes to her medication regimen to help relieve these symptoms. Diuretic medications, for instance, can help reduce excess fluid in the body and could possibly help with her leg cramps and edema. The doctor might also suggest changes to her diet, such as reducing sodium intake, to help manage fluid levels.",

Non-prescription remedies such as steam inhalations can also help alleviate these symptoms. However, if the symptoms continue or become severe, such as experiencing severe difficulty breathing, chest pain, or if you start to cough up mucus, it is important that you seek medical attention immediately.

Irradiation can result in inflammation and changes in the mucous membranes inside the mouth and throat, leading to increased production of mucus, discomfort, and potential difficulty in swallowing.\n\nIt is important to maintain open communication with your husband's doctors about his symptoms, as they may recommend remedies to help provide relief. Over-the-counter medications, prescription medications, or various throat lozenges could potentially be recommended to help manage excess mucus. \n\nAdditionally, drinking plenty of fluids can help thin the mucus, making it easier to cough up.

    "618": "Hello. Although you've had two periods since the last time you had unprotected sex, the changes in your periods and your symptoms could suggest pregnancy, though they could also be attributed to other conditions or hormonal variations. Given your history of recent surgery and the fact that you are actively trying to conceive, I would recommend taking another pregnancy test, ideally with a first morning urine sample, as the hormone HCG, which is present during pregnancy, is usually highest at that time. Given the negativity of previous tests, the chance of pregnancy may be less, but it's still worth testing again. If the result is negative and your symptoms continue, I would recommend seeing your healthcare provider to discuss these symptoms. Lastly, remember that with only one ovary, it may take longer to conceive, but it's still very possible. Be patient and take good care of your health in the meantime. Good luck!",

I recommend you schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor or a gastroenterologist. They may want to do further testing, which could include blood tests, urine tests, an ultrasound, or possibly an endoscopy or CT scan.

    "624": "Hello, persistent fever during pregnancy warrants investigation. Fever is the body's response to an underlying condition, and while it's generally not harmful to the baby itself, the condition causing the fever, whether an infection or other illness, might be.

Additionally, long-term (chronic) fever in rare cases may lead to preterm birth or low birth weight, so it's important to seek medical attention promptly. \n\nGiven your fever for 4 days, I recommend you to visit your doctor as soon as possible for further evaluation to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. The physician will evaluate your symptoms, conduct necessary tests, and may prescribe appropriate medications.\n\nRemember to continue checking the baby's movements and report any changes to your healthcare provider.

    "629": "Hi Greg, \nThe MRI brain result you're referring to shows that there are changes in the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres that are consistent with chronic ischemia - a condition when there is insufficient blood flow to the brain over a long period of time. This can be caused by arteriosclerotic changes, a disease in which the arteries become hardened and narrow, leading to reduced blood flow. The small vessels (called capillaries) become less efficient at delivering blood to the brain tissue. \n\nThese ischemic changes are often found in patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol levels, or in smokers. This is generally a common age-related process, but can be accelerated by the afore-mentioned risk factors. \n\nThe fact that there's no mass effect or midline shift means that there is no large mass (such as a tumor) pushing structures in the brain out of their normal position.\nThe rest of the brain such as basal ganglia, cerebellar hemispheres, brainstem, internal auditory canal, ventricular system, sellar and parasellar regions, and calvarium, are all normal.\n\nIn terms of management, if there are stroke-like symptoms or risk factors like those I've mentioned, these should be addressed to slow down the progression of the disease. This usually involves lifestyle changes and potentially medication. You should discuss these aspects with your mother's doctor, who will be able to provide appropriate advice taking into account other health factors.\n\nI hope",

Amoxicillin usually starts working 24-72 hours after you start taking it, but the inflammation and pain may persist for several days. However, the relief from pain is not an indication of the infection resolving; you should complete the full course of the antibiotic provided by your dentist.\n\nIf your pain worsens or persists beyond 72 hours, or if you experience any new symptoms, you should contact your dentist immediately. The infection might require a different antibiotic, an increase in dosage, or a dental procedure like draining the abscess or a root canal treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, over-the-counter pain relievers and warm salt water rinses (half a teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water) may help alleviate your pain. Remember, do not stop taking the antibiotic prematurely and always follow your dentist's advice.\n\nPlease remember that my advice is intended to be used as a guide and it's always a good idea to seek the opinion and assistance of a healthcare professional who can review your individual circumstances.",

Sticking to a regular sex schedule, especially during the woman's fertile window, can increase your chances.

Emotional stress also plays a role in conception. Therefore, maintaining a balanced diet, active lifestyle and a stress-free environment can help. \n\nRemember, while conceiving can be a challenge for some couples, try to stay positive, and do not hesitate to seek help if you need.

However, I understand that you do not have insurance and this may not be possible for you. \n\nMetronidazole can cause side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, stomach upset, and a metallic taste in your mouth. Do not drink alcohol while taking metronidazole and for at least 3 days after stopping the medicine. \n\nWhile you are self-treating, monitor for signs of worsening infection such as increasing redness, swelling, pain, and drainage. If these occur, stop taking the metronidazole and seek medical attention promptly. \n\nFinally, remember to take the medication until it's completely finished-infections can return if you do not complete the full course of antibiotics.\n\nPlease note that while I have provided advice to the best of my ability, this advice is not a substitute for a professional medical opinion. My advice does not establish a doctor-patient relationship. Please consult a healthcare provider before you decide to take metronidazole or any other medication.",
    "639": "Hello AAA,\n\nThe symptoms you describe can be side effects of discontinuing Depo-Provera, especially noting that the shot can affect your body's hormonal balance for up to a year after the last injection. That being said, it's also possible that these symptoms could be related to pregnancy. However, as you've mentioned, you've taken a home pregnancy test and it's negative. \n\nDepo-Provera should not cause a 'false negative' result on a home pregnancy test. If you still haven't gotten your period and continue to experience these symptoms, it would be a good idea to contact your healthcare provider. They may want to conduct a blood pregnancy test to rule out early pregnancy as a cause of your symptoms. It might be necessary to explore other causes too, such as hormonal imbalances or other conditions.\n\nRemember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information.",
    "640": "Hello. From your description, it sounds like you are dealing not only with hemorrhoids but also possibly an anal abscess, or a small boil like you mentioned. It would be less likely to be a fistula if there is no discharge. However, since it is recurring and causing discomfort, I strongly recommend that you see a doctor to get it evaluated. If it is an abscess, it may need to be drained, and potentially may require antibiotics if there is an infection. \n\nIn the meantime, you can continue the sitz baths and cold packs. Those are useful both for hemorrhoids and for perianal discomfort. Over-the-counter pain medications may be of some use as well. For your diet, try to consume foods rich in fiber and keep yourself hydrated to ensure you do not eliminate hard stool which can exacerbate the condition. A stool softener like docusate can also be very helpful. \n\nAgain, please make an appointment with your primary care doctor or a specialist (such as a proctologist) in order to get this properly diagnosed and treated. Take care.",
    "641": "Hello,\n\nThe normal sperm count is 20 million/ml or more, so your sperm count is on the lower side. In regards to motility, at least 50% of spermatozoa should have normal motility. Your motility is at 10%, which is quite low.\n\nThough the presence of pus cells could indicate an infection which may have negatively impacted your sperm count and motility.\n\nMy advice would be as follows:\n\n1. Consult a urologist to treat any possible infections as indicated by the presence of pus cells. You may need a course of antibiotics.\n\n2. Abstain from smoking and alcohol, maintain a healthy diet rich in antioxidants (found in fruits and vegetables) and consider starting a regular exercise routine.\n\n3. The parameters could improve naturally after the treatment of any infection. However, if there is no improvement, you may need further evaluation and a possible referral to a fertility specialist.\n\nPlease persist and stay positive, infertility is challenging but with modern medicine there are various treatments available. Best of luck to you.",
    "642": "Hi, what you're describing could be the normal production of pre-ejaculatory fluid or \"pre-cum\". This is something that your body does whenever it becomes aroused, such as during sexual thoughts, touching, or activities. It is completely normal and should not be something that you have to worry about. However, if you are experiencing pain, discomfort, or if the secretion is itchy, has a foul smell, or the color changes, it would be best to consult with a healthcare provider to rule out possibilities of an infection or other conditions. Nevertheless, it's important to maintain good hygiene to prevent any potential problems. Hope this helps.",
    "643": "Hello, firstly I understand how frustrating and potentially distressing OCD can be. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common, treatable mental health issue that affects many people. Some people find that cognitive-behavioral therapy can be very effective in controlling and even eliminating their OCD symptoms.\n\nRegarding your pronunciation problem, it's best to remind yourself that there may not be a universally 'correct' pronunciation for many names and brands, especially as pronunciation can differ between regions and accents. Therefore, there's no need to stress about it. \n\nGenerally, to deal with OCD, you have to train your brain to tolerate the doubt, the fear, and the uncertainty. When the intrusive thoughts appear in your mind, acknowledge them without trying to refute them or act on them, and let them pass.\n\nPlease remember that while this advice may be useful, it's important to consult a mental health professional who can provide you with a personalized treatment plan for managing your OCD symptoms based on your specific needs.",
    "644": "Hello, it seems like you have concerns about a lump on your waist. It's great that you're scheduled to have an ultrasound, as it will provide more information about this lump you're feeling. Given its location and description, it could be a variety of things such as a lipoma (benign fat tissue tumor), a cyst, or even a hernia. The term \"tissue band\" may refer to a thickening of fascia (connective tissue under the skin), which can sometimes occur and create a lump-like feeling. It's difficult to confirm without imaging or physical examination. The ultrasound will help determine the nature of this lump and guide the next steps. Continue with the planned ultrasound as suggested by your doctor. Let's wait for the results and discuss further. Don't hesitate to ask if you have more questions.",
    "645": "I'm sorry to hear that your daughter is going through this. It definitely does seem like your daughter's mental health needs to be prioritized. Experiencing prolonged periods of depression in conjunction with increased paranoia can potentially indicate an underlying psychiatric condition that is best addressed by a medical professional.\n\nThe steps you've mentioned are all great; indeed, it would be helpful for her to start counseling as well as getting a psychiatric assessment to explore whether antidepressant or other psychiatric medication might be beneficial. A thorough neurologic evaluation is also recommended to rule out any organic brain issues, especially given the recent history of falls.\n\nPlease note that it's vital to ensure that your daughter is actively participating and consenting to these treatments. Mental health care is incredibly personal and it's essential that your daughter feels comfortable and engaged with whoever she's working with.\n\nIn the meantime, provide a supportive and understanding environment that encourages open dialogue around mental health. Try to reassure her that her feelings are valid and it's okay to seek help. Maintaining a sense of routine, encouraging a healthy lifestyle and promoting activities she enjoys can also aid her recovery.",
    "646": "Hello, I understand your concern. Emergency contraceptive pills, like i-pill, are most effective if taken within 24 hours and still provide protection if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. The effectiveness of emergency contraception decreases with time after unprotected sex. However, considering you have taken the i-pill within 36 hours, it should have significantly reduced your chances of getting pregnant and was a responsible step to take.\n\nThe fact that you had unprotected sex two days after ovulation may lessen your chances of getting pregnant, as the egg is only viable for 12-24 hours after ovulation. Sperm, however, can live up to 5 days inside a woman's body. \n\nAs for the withdrawal bleeding, it varies from woman to woman and does not necessarily occur on a schedule. The i-pill can make your periods irregular for the cycle it was used, by either delaying it or making it come early.\n\nEven with emergency contraception, pregnancy is still a possibility. I would recommend waiting until your expected period date and if you miss this period, a pregnancy test could provide more clarity.\n\nRemember, using emergency contraception regularly is not advisable and it's better to use a long term effective method. Always consult with a healthcare provider for the best contraceptive methods suitable for you. Taking HIV, STDs, and other factors into consideration is crucial. Practice safe sex to protect your health.",
    "647": "Hi, Thanks for asking. Bone and prostate cancer are serious conditions and the treatments, such as radiation therapy, can sometimes affect the body's ability to produce blood cells, including platelets and hemoglobin. This may be what's causing your boyfriend's low levels. \n\nTransfusions are a common method to temporarily raise these levels. However, whether his platelet and hemoglobin levels will return to normal on their own depends on several factors, including the extent of the cancers, the effectiveness of his treatments, and his overall health. \n\nThe most important thing is to ensure he is receiving appropriate treatment for his cancers and managing any side effects, such as the low platelet and hemoglobin levels. His doctor should be monitoring these levels closely and adjusting treatment as necessary. \n\nPlease voice any concerns or questions to his healthcare team. They can provide the most accurate advice according to his specific medical situation. Always stay hopeful and positive, your support is vital for his recovery. I wish you both all the best.",
    "648": "Low iron levels in a child of this age is a concern, especially if he appears pale and has low energy. Iron is crucial for the production of red blood cells and hemoglobin which carry oxygen throughout the body. Without it, your child may have problems with growth and development, as well as general fatigue and weakness.\n\nAn iron level of 8 is low for a child of his age, and failing response to oral iron (Ferritin) certainly needs further investigation. This could mean a malabsorption issue, an ongoing blood loss or less commonly, another medical issue.\n\nI'd recommend seeking a second opinion and consider a referral to a pediatric hematologist (a specialist in blood disorders in children) for further assessment and management. Until then, continue to provide iron-rich foods such as meats, beans, fortified cereals, and green leafy vegetables. It's also beneficial to couple these with Vitamin C rich foods like oranges, as they improve iron absorption.\n\nDelaying appropriate management could lead to iron deficiency anemia - a severe form of iron deficiency which has more serious implications like impaired cognitive and motor development.\n\nPlease take this situation seriously and seek further evaluation and management.\n\nYour child's health is important and any concerns you have should be addressed.",
    "649": "I'm sorry to hear your daughter is experiencing this. Normally sternum pain by itself could be related to costochondritis which is inflammation in chest wall area, or muscle strain, heartburn indeed, or even more severe conditions like heart disease. However, the combination of symptoms you described including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing alongside the sternum pain sound concerning. It could point to a condition called esophagitis, aspiration pneumonia, or in rarer instances a mass in the chest. I recommend going to the ER, particularly if she is experiencing trouble breathing. It is important that she be seen as soon as possible to figure out what is going on and get appropriate intervention.",
    "650": "Hello, After getting fillings, some discomfort is normal because the filling process can irritate the nerve inside the tooth. It should subside within a week or two. Pain when eating, however, could indicate a problem. This might be because the filling is too high, as your second dentist suggested, or there might be an issue with the nerves inside your tooth. Now, filing down the filling was a good first step, but if the discomfort persists you should certainly get it checked out again. You may need to go for an X-ray to determine the nature of the problem. Meanwhile you may try a sensitivity toothpaste and avoid extreme temperature foods. Kindly make an appointment to see your dentist again if the problem persists.",
    "651": "I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing this pain. You must contact your Orthopedic specialist immediately for thorough examination and proper diagnostics; pain that's severe enough to disrupt sleep shouldn't be ignored. This could be a nerve-related issue, a problem with circulation, or an issue related to the previous surgery. In the interim, you should continue to keep the leg elevated and try using a hot or cold compress for temporary relief. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen may also help, but the severity and duration of your symptoms indicate that you need to be seen by a specialist as soon as possible.",
    "652": "Hi, thank you for your question. Your semen volume is a bit unclear as the unit of measurement is missing, typically it's in milliliters (ml) and the normal range is around 1.5ml to 7ml. A sperm count of 7 million is low as in general, doctors like to see a count of at least 20 million sperm per ml of semen. Sperm motility is important as well, average or 'normal' motility is considered to be 40% or more. This means that healthy sperm are likely to move and 'swim' and a motility of 35% is a bit lower than preferred.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that these numbers are just general guidelines and many men with lower numbers are still able to father children naturally. If you're finding it difficult to conceive naturally, I would recommend seeing a healthcare provider for further investigation on both your and your partner's fertility. Treatments are often available to help with these issues. \n\nIn the meantime, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help improve semen quality. This includes regular exercise, a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and keeping alcohol consumption to a minimum.",
    "653": "I'm glad you reached out for advice. Pravastatin, like other statin medications, is known to potentially cause elevated liver enzymes in some people. It's a good idea to take a break from the medicine to see if your liver enzyme levels go back down to normal. A period of 4-6 weeks is generally sufficient to affect liver enzyme levels; however, it's always best to follow your doctor's advice. \n\nTypically if the liver enzymes decrease after stopping the medication, it suggests that the liver can recover, which is good news. It doesn't necessarily mean that pravastatin can be resumed without any risk, though—it simply indicates that the drug may have been causing the increase in the first place. \n\nAfter your follow-up tests, your doctor may consider adjusting your dosage or prescribing a different medication for your high cholesterol. That's because even if pravastatin was the cause of your elevated liver enzymes, other statins might be safer for your liver while still effectively lowering your cholesterol.\n\nRemember, medications are only one approach to controlling cholesterol. Discuss with your doctor about lifestyle modifications such as changes to your diet, weight loss, and regular physical activity that can help you maintain healthy cholesterol levels.\n\nPlease follow up with your doctor as advised and don't hesitate to seek out other medical opinions if you're not satisfied with the responses you receive. Because everyone's situation is unique, it's critical to have a personalized plan of care. And remember to never change or",
    "654": "Hi, sorry to hear about your uncomfortable situation. Pulling a muscle, especially while pregnant, can be extremely painful. Complete rest is recommended for such cases, because overusing the muscle can cause further harm. Applying heat to the affected area can help to soothe and relax the muscle. Painful breathing and sneezing could suggest that the muscle pull was in the chest or rib area. You can take paracetamol safely during pregnancy for pain relief, but avoid taking ibuprofen as it's not safe for pregnant women in the third trimester. However, take your doctor's advice before starting any medication. I also strongly recommend seeing a physical therapist to properly evaluate your stance and the way you're using the crutches to ensure that you're not overusing or straining other muscles. If the pain is not improving or worsening over time, I recommend you go to the ER immediately to rule out any other more serious injuries, such as a rib fracture. Hope you feel better soon.",
    "655": "Hello Ashton, first off, self-medication (including taking someone else's prescriptions) can be dangerous and is not recommended. It's good to see that you're reaching out for assistance, though. Based on your description, it does seem like you could be struggling with ADHD or ADD, particularly since there is a family history of the same. Symptoms like a wandering mind, difficulty in maintaining a schedule, inability to keep focus, and impulsive spending are common indicators. However, a professional diagnosis is crucial. \n\nPlease, reach out to a healthcare professional in your area to discuss these concerns. They can do a proper evaluation and suggest the right treatment options. There are several effective treatments for ADHD, including medication, psychotherapy, education or training, or a combination of treatments. \n\nRemember, it may take some time to find what works best for you. It's a process and can be frustrating, but it's important to be patient and keep in close contact with your doctor. Discuss any concerns you have about medications with them. It's the best way to ensure you find the right treatment for your ADHD.",
    "656": "I'm really sorry to hear about your mom's current health situation. Both Remeron (Mirtazapine) and Risperidone are commonly used in the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders. From a psychiatric perspective, these medications are generally considered safe when administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional. However, all medications carry some risk of side effects. \n\nIn general, Risperidone is an antipsychotic medication used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability associated with autistic disorder. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant that is also used to treat anxiety, and sometimes prescribed for patients with dementia who have depression or behavioral issues. \n\nIt's very important that the doctor prescribing these medications is well aware of her full medical history including her bypass surgery in 1997 and her heart attacks. These medications should be used very cautiously in the elderly, especially those with existing heart disease, since they can sometimes lead to changes in heart rhythm or blood pressure. It’s also important to carefully monitor her for any new or worsening symptoms. \n\nPlease be sure to express your concerns to the healthcare team. Frequent communication will help to ensure that they have all the information that they need to care for your mom in the best possible way.",
    "657": "I am sorry to hear about your wife's diagnosis. However, it is encouraging that there are no signs of distant metastasis according to the PET scan. The involvement of the lymph nodes suggests a high risk of cancer recurrence, thus the recommendation for chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The plan proposed by your oncologist is standard for such a case. The aim of chemotherapy is to kill any cancer cells that may have spread from the breast to other parts of the body, but are too small to be seen on the scans. Radiation therapy aims to kill any remaining cancer cells in and around the breast or armpit. This is often used after surgery to reduce the risk of the cancer returning in the same breast. I know chemotherapy might sound scary, but modern drugs and supportive care are more effective in managing side effects compared to years ago. Finally, remember that it's incredibly important to have open discussions with your oncology team about your concerns and the pros and cons of therapy.\n",

They might want to conduct some tests, such as a urine analysis or a renal function test, to ascertain the cause of your discomfort. Then, appropriate treatment can be started. Please keep monitoring your symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if they worsen.",
    "659": "Hello, It's certainly challenging to see your little one go through this. As a doctor, I would highly recommend continuing with the hearing aid as that's the most scientifically validated method of treating Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SHL).\n\nRegarding her blocked nose and frequent colds, it sounds like she may be suffering from a type of allergy, possibly allergic rhinitis. This making it important that you manage and reduce her exposure to potential allergens, such as dust mites or pet dander.\n\nShe should also be evaluated by a pediatric allergist or an ENT specialist. Medications such as antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal steroids could be used depending on the severity and frequency of symptoms. In some cases, allergy immunotherapy (allergy shots) could be recommended by the allergist.\n\nRegarding homeopathic treatment, while some individuals find improvement in their symptoms, the efficacy of homeopathic treatments is often individual and it has not been proven consistently in large, controlled clinical trials. It's important to discuss these options with a healthcare provider who is familiar with your daughter's medical history.\n\nRemember that managing symptoms will provide the most relief. Maintain good hydration, use saline nasal sprays to keep nasal passages moist, and consider using a humidifier in her room while she sleeps. \n\nIt's important that she sees a pediatrician or an ENT specialist to address these issues further. These tips can help alleviate her symptoms in the meantime. \n\nThank you, and take care.",
    "660": "I'm very sorry to hear about the loss of your mom and the current condition of your sister. I understand your concerns and your feelings of responsibility.\n\nThe episode you described with your mom sounds like what is often described as a \"terminal event\" or \"agonal event.\" These can be very distressing to witness, but they're typically due to the brain's reaction to lowered oxygen and blood flow, not due to too much oxygen being given. It's unlikely that oxygen administration contributes to these types of events. Oxygen is often used in end-of-life care to make patients more comfortable.\n\nThe use of oxygen in patients with advanced cancer who are nearing the end of life is generally safe provided it's appropriately administered and monitored. Typically, oxygen use can help relieve symptoms of breathlessness and hypoxia in these patients.\n\nAlways remember that as a healthcare proxy, your role was to carry out your mom's healthcare wishes to the best of your ability, and based on the information you had. If you have questions or concerns, I would encourage you to speak with your sister's doctor. They can provide clarification and reassurance about these matters.",
    "661": "Based on the symptoms you've described, it does sound like you could have internal hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus that can be itchy, painful, and potentially cause bleeding during bowel movements. Internal hemorrhoids can become prolapsed, meaning they protrude from the anus, but they also tend to retract on their own after bowel movements or when relaxing/standing. They can often result from straining during bowel movements or sitting for extended periods of time on the toilet. \n\nHowever, it's important not to self-diagnose. I would strongly suggest that you see a doctor or specialist such as a gastroenterologist or proctologist for proper evaluation and treatment. Remember, there's no need to be embarrassed - they are medical professionals trained to deal with such issues. \n\nFor temporary relief, over-the-counter remedies like hemorrhoid creams or suppositories can be used. Increasing fiber in your diet can also help by softening your stool and making it easier to pass. Warm sitz baths might provide some relief as well. \n\nIf you notice an increase in bleeding, pain, or if the lump does not retreat, please seek medical care urgently.",
    "662": "Certainly it is a concern because the symptoms seem to be worsening and not getting better. The back pain could be due to body aches related to the fever. The fever and body aches seem consistent with a flu or a flu-like illness. Even though you are otherwise healthy and young, flu can make you much sicker than a common cold. Given your exposure to Streptococcal infection and recent worsening of symptoms, it would be wise to revisit your doctor to get rechecked. Streptococcal infections, if left untreated may lead to more serious conditions. Try to rest, keep yourself hydrated. Try to keep pain and fever down with over-the-counter medications like Tylenol or Ibuprofen.",
    "663": "Hello, often a traumatic injury like this can cause damage not only to the skin, but also to the underlying tissues, including the muscles and connective tissues. Although the wound on the skin may have healed, the tissues beneath might still be in a process of repair. \n\nHowever, the redness and swelling around the wound can also be signs of inflammation or infection. Without warmth, it's less likely to be an infection, but it's still a possibility. You should seek medical attention if you're experiencing increasing pain, the swelling is expanding, or you develop systematic symptoms like fever. \n\nIn this case, your best option is to see a healthcare provider for further evaluation to ensure there is no infection or other complication occurring that would require treatment. If you're not experiencing any limitations in your mobility and no worsening symptoms, it might still be part of the healing process. So don't worry too much. Please keep monitoring the area closely and seek medical attention as needed.",
    "664": "I'm sorry to hear about your extended discomfort. Given the circumstances and the fact that the pain has persisted for weeks following trauma, I'd recommend seeking another medical opinion. An orthopedist or a sports medicine specialist may be more equipped to identify any potential musculoskeletal injuries from your football incidences. Imaging like X-rays or an MRI scan can also help in identifying any structural issues - disc problems, fractures, or other soft tissue injuries that might not be immediately noticeable. In the meantime, avoid strenuous physical activities that might increase the pain.\nPlease remember that while over-the-counter pain medication may offer temporary relief, they are not a long-term solution and overuse can lead to other health problems. Applying ice or heat to the painful areas might also provide temporary relief.",
    "665": "Hello, You are obviously concerned about your son. If your child isn't eating but is drinking plenty of fluids, that's a good sign as it means he's not dehydrating. The fever is also not abnormally high for a child. Small children often get fevers when fighting off infections or illnesses, so it isn't necessarily a cause for alarm unless it won't go down after several days, or if it gets any higher. \n\nHowever, if the fever lasts longer than 5 days, it's necessary to see a medical professional, since it could be something more serious. It can also be a hint that the body is having a hard time fighting off the illness. \n\nThese illnesses can be bacterial, in which case antibiotics might be needed. But more often than not, they are viral illnesses such as the flu or a cold. \n\nSo in summary, keep doing what you're doing but if after 5 days your son's condition doesn't improve, consult with a healthcare provider again. If his demeanor changes drastically, he has difficulty breathing, has a rash or is unable to keep down fluids, seek immediate medical attention. \n\nYou should always follow your instincts as a parent; you know your son better than anyone.",
    "666": "Hello, I understand your concerns given your previous history of breast cancer. It's important to clarify that both scar tissue and cancerous lumps can bleed during a biopsy and the presence or absence of bleeding or bruising afterward doesn't necessarily indicate one or the other. The biopsy needle often goes through blood vessels, which can cause bleeding and subsequently bruising, but this can vary widely from person to person based on their individual biology, including their platelet count, clotting factors, and the specific site of the biopsy. Also, there is variation in the way our bodies react to trauma and some people might develop bruising and others might not. So, I'd suggest waiting for the biopsy results for a definitive answer. In case of persistent worry or new symptoms, contact your healthcare provider promptly.",
    "668": "Hello,\n\nIntracranial aneurysms can be a cause of concern, but it's encouraging that your neurologist believes it's something you may have had for a long time. Your age, the size of the aneurysm, and its location are all things that must be considered when deciding a course of treatment. \n\nGiven the small size of your aneurysm (4mm), it's not entirely surprising that your neurologist chose to monitor rather than perform a coiling procedure immediately. This is often the approach taken for small aneurysms, especially when there's a risk to vision like in your case.\n\nAneurysms can remain stable, stay the same size, or grow slowly over time. There is also a small risk of rupture, which is why your neurologist will continue to monitor its size and position.\n\nThe best thing you can do is to control your risk factors for growth or rupture, which include high blood pressure, smoking, alcohol intake, and high cholesterol. Staying active, following a balanced diet, and regular checkups with your neurologist are other important steps towards maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n\nRemember, it's normal to be concerned after a diagnosis like this. It's good that you're questioning and learning. I would recommend discussing any further concerns with your neurologist the next time you see them. They can provide more personalized advice and reassurances.",

    "670": "I'm sorry to hear about your father's health issue. However, persistent symptoms like these, that both a cardiologist and gastroenterologist cannot attribute to their fields of specialization, may warrant a more comprehensive approach. The symptoms you mention could arguably be due to nerve impingements or other musculoskeletal origins. Additionally, these symptoms can be associated with anxiety or other psychological issues, which can be common following major surgery. \n\nA neurologist or a pain specialist may be able to give further insights or recommendation for managing these symptoms, ruling out conditions such as neuropathy. A psychiatric evaluation could also be helpful if anxiety is contributing to these problems. Furthermore, a second opinion from another cardiologist or gastroenterologist may be worth considering. In any case, pursuing this with healthcare professionals until you get satisfactory answers is advised. \n\nRemember that it is also crucial to ensure that your father is compliant with all his post-operation medication, and make certain he reports any changes he experiences.",

Small sips of rehydration solutions (like Pedialyte) throughout the day can help.\n\nHer paleness could be due to the sickness itself or it may suggest that she's not getting enough iron in her diet, which can cause anemia.

    "673": "Hello Dianne, Instaflex contains ingredients including glucosamine and turmeric, which may possibly increase blood pressure in some individuals. However, it's generally uncommon and may depend on individual body responses. If you have a history of hypertension or are currently on blood pressure medication, monitoring your blood pressure while starting this treatment is a good idea. If you notice any significant increases, stop the medication and consult with your healthcare provider.",
    "674": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is primarily a blood-borne virus, and the most common modes of infection are through exposure to small quantities of blood such as from sharing needles, syringes or other injecting drug equipment, from the mother to the baby at the time of birth, and through sexual contact.\n\nIn your case, if your mother's blood came into contact with your son's skin or mouth, the risk of transmission exists, but it is incredibly low, especially if there are no open wounds, cuts, or sores in the mouth or on the skin that could have come into contact with the virus.\n\nI understand that you are worried and it's important to remember that hepatitis C virus is not transmitted through casual or brief contact, like hugging, kissing, sneezing, coughing, or even food sharing, unless the blood of the infected person has a route to the bloodstream of another person.\n\nYou should get tested as a precaution since you were born to a mother with Hep C, though the risk of transmission during childbirth is low. As for your son, you can always seek advice from your healthcare provider but given your description, the risk seems extremely low. \n\nAlways remember, there's no single piece of advice that will fit all situations and individuals differ. When in doubt, it's always better to consult with your healthcare provider.",
    "675": "Hello. Thank you for providing a detailed history. Based on your description, it sounds like you might be experiencing an oral infection, possibly due to incomplete healing post-dental procedures, or an unrelated infectious process. \n\nThe white patches at the back of your tongue may be due to a yeast infection (oral thrush), common in people with weakened immune systems or who have had recent dental procedures, which is known to cause pain, redness, and occasionally bleeding.\n\nSwollen lymph nodes and tongue swelling may be your body's immune response to the infection. Still, it would be best to make sure there's no blockage or issues with your salivary glands, which can also cause similar symptoms.\n\nWhile your periodontist might not think there's a major problem based on their inspection, it's still crucial to get a second opinion if symptoms persist. Please consult an oral surgeon or an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist to rule out any other potential issues and get proper treatment.\n\nTill then, keep maintaining good oral hygiene, rinse your mouth with warm salt water 2-3 times a day, especially after meals to keep the area clean.\n\nIt's essential to remember that this advice is based only on the symptoms that you've described, and it would be better to get evaluated in person by a healthcare provider. Contact your doctor as soon as possible for a complete examination.\n",
    "676": "Hello Deepti,\n\nFrom your sister's MRI report, it shows that she has some disc bulges in her lower back (L4-L5 and L5-S1) causing some pressure on the nerve roots. This is likely the cause of her back pain. \n\nBefore going for surgery, there are several other non-surgical treatment options that can be tried like:\n\n1. Physical Therapy: A physical therapist can teach exercises designed to improve flexibility and strength, which ultimately delivers more supportive lower back and leg muscles.\n\n2. Pain medication: Non-prescription medications may be enough to help. If not, stronger prescription drugs can be used which includes muscle relaxants or in some cases narcotic painkillers.\n\n3. Steroid Injections: If the pain is severe, injecting steroids into the area around the spinal nerves might suppress inflammation and relieve the pain.\n\nSurgery is usually the last resort if all other treatments fail and if the pain is severe and disabling after ample period of conservative treatments. Following a correct course of treatment usually brings relief in couple of months. You may consult a neurologist or a neurosurgeon to discuss and explore these options.\n\nBest wishes, take care.",
    "677": "Hello,\nThank you for bringing this to my attention. From the symptoms you have described, it's likely that there may be some form of nerve irritation or possible injury in your hand, especially affecting the small finger. This could have resulted from a trauma that perhaps went unnoticed or repetitive strain. The ulnar nerve, which provides sensation to the pinky and half of the ring finger, may have been affected.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that these symptoms could be due to conditions like peripheral neuropathy, which can create burning sensations and increased sensitivity in the hands or feet. Certain systemic conditions like diabetes or vitamin B deficiencies can lead to peripheral neuropathy.\n\nIt would be prudent to consult with your doctor or a specialist, as they would be able to evaluate your symptoms efficiently and order the necessary diagnostic tests, such as a nerve conduction study to assess the function of your nerves. If needed, they might also refer you to a specialist like a neurologist or a hand surgeon for further evaluation.\n\nFor now, try not to use your hand strenuously and consider over-the-counter pain medicine if the pain is severe and persistent. Warm compresses may also help with the burning sensation. But please follow-up with a healthcare provider regardless.\n\nPlease note, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate examination and treatment.\n",
    "678": "Hello, it sounds like you're experiencing quite an upheaval. Steroid injections can sometimes cause disruptions to the menstrual cycle. This is due to the influence steroids have over the hormones in your body. It's not uncommon to experience changes to menstrual cycle duration and frequency following a steroid shot.\n\nHowever, three weeks is quite a long period for a menstrual cycle. It may be a good idea to discuss these symptoms with your doctor before you proceed with another epidural, particularly if your bleeding is heavy or you're feeling light-headed or excessively fatigued.\n\nIn regards to your fertility, one-off steroid injections for pain relief are not generally thought to have long-term effects on fertility. However, you may want to discuss this concern with your doctor, particularly as you are 40 and may be more conscious of your fertility than you were earlier in life. It would be good to have a discussion with your health care provider about this and also consider consulting a fertility specialist. Remember to look after yourself in this stressful time and ensure you're getting enough rest and maintaining a balanced diet.",
    "679": "Hello, and thank you for sharing your concern. From your description, it does sound like you might be suffering from a chronic allergic condition. Chronic cough, sneezing, and occasional fever are symptoms often associated with allergic rhinitis. Bronchitis can also cause similar symptoms, but is often associated with a history of smoking or exposure to significant air pollutants. Although TB can cause a cough and occasional fever, and sometimes sputum with blood, it is associated with other symptoms such as weight loss and night sweats, and your X-ray results were normal which lowers the likelihood of TB.\n\nHowever, I recommended that you consult an Allergist and Immunologist or a Pulmonologist who specializes in lung diseases. You may need to undergo further testing such as skin allergy tests or lung function tests. Management of allergic rhinitis often involves avoiding allergens that trigger your symptoms, as well as using medications to manage symptoms.\n\nRegarding your question about weak lungs, continuous inflammation in the airways owing to allergies can lead to a form of chronic damage, but it's not as if the \"lungs are weak\" per se. The problem often lies in the chronic inflammation in the airways. With proper management and treatment, the state of the airways can be improved.\n\nPlease note that these are general insights based on your description and that it is still strongly advised you get examined by a doctor for a definite diagnosis. It's important to follow your doctor's recommendations for testing or treatment.",
    "680": "Hi, I understand your concerns. Is the pain primarily when breathing deeply? If so, it may be an irritation of the lining of your lungs (pleura), which can occur with things like a viral infection, pneumonia, or pleurisy. Other lung diseases could also cause this feeling of a bubble or a pocket of air. Given your recent medication allergy and the use of a steroid, there could also be a mild allergic reaction irritating your airways. \n\nSudden shortness of breath, particularly if it's associated with chest pain, could signal a serious problem like a blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism) and is treated as a medical emergency. \n\nYou should really contact your doctor and get examined, or at least call and tell them about your symptoms. They may suggest you to get an X-ray or a CT scan of the chest to rule out any lung diseases, especially since you mention that you have difficulty breathing. It's better to consult and clear any potential issues. \nMeanwhile, try to remain calm and take slow, deep breaths. Anxiety or panic can make the symptoms worse. Take care.",
    "681": "Hi, thanks for reaching out. It's not unusual to see acne get worse before it gets better when you're starting on treatments such as Tetralysal (Lymecycline). This is part of the process as the medication works to clear bacteria from the pimple, sometimes causing them to come to the surface. Increased redness and irritation can also accompany this. However, if these side effects remain severe after 4-6 weeks or cause extreme discomfort, it's important to consult your dermatologist. They may adjust your dosage, switch to a different medication, or recommend additional treatments to help soothe your skin. \n\nRegarding increasing the dose to twice daily, it's highly recommended you discuss this with your doctor first. Every skin is different and self medication may lead to further complications. For irritation, a hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic moisturizer can help.\n\nAlso, make sure not to scrub your face too hard to avoid further irritation. If your skin doesn't improve or the side effects worsen, talk to your healthcare provider to discuss alternate treatment options. It often takes time to find the right treatment for acne, but with assistance you can find a suitable solutions. Remember, every problematic stage will be temporary and there's a suitable treatment for everyone.\n",

Try to burp him frequently even mid-feed, every 10 minutes during a feed and then afterward.\n\n2. Put him to bed on his back and elevate the head side of his crib by placing a pair of rolled towels or a thin blanket under the head of his mattress.\n\n3.

Apply honey on your lips before going to bed and let it dry. Leave it overnight and wash it off in the morning.\n\n2. Lemon Juice: The bleaching properties in lemons can help lighten your lips. Apply fresh lemon juice on your lips every night before bed.\n\n3. Cucumber Juice: Just like lemon juice, cucumber juice also has bleaching properties. Rub a slice of cucumber on your lips or apply cucumber juice for a few minutes each day. \n\n4. Rose Water: This can nourish your lips and keep them moisturized, thereby helping to lighten them.

It contains a potent steroid which can cause serious side effects like thinning of the skin, increased acne, facial hair, etc.\n\nReturning to your original skin may take some time, and I suggest that you see a dermatologist to determine the best course of action. Apart from this, resume your Clindamycin gel as it appeared to work well for you in the past.\n\nYour dermatologist may start you on treatments like topical retinoids or benzoyl peroxide preparations. Please avoid self-medicating, especially with steroids, as they can cause more harm than good. Homemade remedies and a balanced diet can also help to some extent.\n\nIt would help to wash your face twice a day using a gentle cleanser. Try to avoid picking at your acne, as it can lead to scarring and more black marks.\n\nRemember, results from treatment can take a couple of months. I hope this advice helps you.",
    "685": "Hello. The symptoms you're experiencing could possibly point to a condition called tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis), which can occur due to repetitive or excessive arm and wrist motions and can cause the tendons in your elbow to become overloaded, leading to inflammation. Exercise may initially improve your symptoms due to the increased blood flow and muscle use. However, continued excessive or inappropriate movement can exacerbate the inflammation leading to an escalation of symptoms.\n\nTo manage this, firstly, you might try resting and avoiding any activities that might inflame your elbow further. Non-prescription anti-inflammatories and over-the-counter pain relievers may help with the inflammation and pain. Applying ice to the affected area might also be beneficial. If your symptoms persist or become worse, consider setting up an appointment with your healthcare provider or a physiotherapist who might recommend an appropriate exercise program which might include strengthening exercises for your arm so as to avoid relapse in the future, or other treatments such as physiotherapy or possibly a brace to protect your elbow. It's important to move your elbow gently so as to prevent stiffness but to avoid causing any additional inflammation by over modern it.",
    "686": "Hello, it sounds like you may have developed a case of bronchitis, which is an inflammation in the lining of the bronchial tubes. This can often happen after a cold or other upper respiratory infection. Symptoms can include a persistent cough that brings up mucus, chest tightness or pain, and even a low-grade fever. It's also possible that the repeated coughing has strained a muscle in your chest, causing the pain. \n\nHowever, if your symptoms persist or worsen, I would recommend that you seek medical attention. While most cases of bronchitis can be treated at home with rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medication, your healthcare provider may want to rule out conditions like pneumonia or tuberculosis, especially if you have additional symptoms like shortness of breath or significant chest pain. Any persistent chest pain should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. I hope this helps and you feel better soon!",

Stressors, such as a new marriage and a new living environment, can often trigger these types of problems.\n\nRisdone, also known as Risperidone, is an antipsychotic medication that is often used to treat symptoms of psychiatric disorders. However, it may not be enough for her current situation, or the dosage might need to be adjusted.\n\nIt's crucial to get her in to see a mental health professional as soon as possible. I understand she's resistant to this idea, but her safety and well-being are the priority here. Offer to go with her or to help her set up the appointment if that might make it easier for her. \n\nIt may also be helpful to discuss with her doctor or a pharmacist about the best way to administer her medication, especially if she is being forgetful or uncooperative.\n\nTry to make sure she is in a safe environment where there is minimal chance for her to harm herself or others. Keep in mind that forced treatment should be considered as the last resort and used only when all other options have failed and the person is at severe risk.\n\nFinally, consider reaching out to local mental health organizations or hotlines for additional resources and support for both your sister and your family.

The cold packs along with the paracetamol you've given him should help with pain and swelling.\n\nIf you're really worried, if he develops any of the above-mentioned symptoms, or if the swelling doesn't start to go down after a couple of days, then you should take him to the A&E just to be safe. If he seems alright otherwise, just make sure you continue to carefully observe him over the next 24-48 hours.

In order to fully understand why this happened to you, your doctor would need to conduct some further tests. Please follow up with your primary care physician or a hematologist to get more information. Make sure to keep eating a healthy diet rich in iron, vitamin B12, and folate to help your body make red blood cells.",
    "690": "Hello, thank you for reaching out. Charcot foot, or neuropathic arthropathy, is a common problem for diabetic patients. You correctly pointed out that wearing special therapeutic footwear is essential for managing this condition. This can prevent further deformity and limit the possibility of developing ulcers. \n\nIn addition to this, below are some of the precautions that you should practice:\n\n1. Regularly inspect your feet for any new injuries or changes.\n2. Always keep your feet clean and dry.\n3. Regularly see a podiatrist for foot care.\n\nMedication is generally not used for the treatment of Charcot foot. The primary management is through foot care, use of custom footwear and bracing, and, in some cases, surgery.\n\nSince diabetes can cause changes in the sense of touch in your feet, monitoring blood glucose levels consistently and controlling the diabetes is also crucial. \n\nYes, regular follow-ups with your healthcare provider is necessary for managing this condition. They can evaluate the progression of the disease and adjust treatment plans as necessary. \n\nPlease do not neglect any foot problems. Even minimal injuries can turn into serious conditions, given the background of diabetes. Please keep in touch with your doctor and follow the recommended plan.",
    "691": "I'm really sorry to hear you're dealing with this, it seems like you're dealing with a lot right now. Chronic back pain and surgical interventions can indeed affect the nerves that innervate the pelvic region, potentially causing the symptoms you've described. Nerve impingement or damage from surgeries could also contribute to your reduced libido.\n\nGiven your sexual concerns and the length of time they’ve been present, it would be advisable to discuss this with your primary healthcare provider or see a urologist. If the lack of sexual desire is related to a hormone imbalance, this could potentially be addressed with therapy. However, it's equally important to mention that stress, anxiety and chronic pain could be affecting your libido, too.\n\nAside from this, it's good to engage in any form of moderate exercise you're capable of - staying physically active can help reduce pain and improve mood, both of which could potentially improve your libido. Also try to maintain a healthy diet and ensure you're sleeping adequately.\n\nRemember, every case is unique and your situation would best be addressed by seeking medical advice from a healthcare provider who can evaluate you in person. I wish you well.",
    "692": "It's understandable that you're worried given your family history. Vemlidy is indeed a commonly prescribed medication for Hepatitis B. It's important to know that while the list of potential side effects can be long, they are not guaranteed to occur, and many people take this medication with manageable or no side effects.\n\nA second opinion certainly never hurts if you're uncomfortable and want to explore all of your options. Regarding medical cannabis, there's no strong evidence to show it can treat Hep B itself, though it might help manage some symptoms or side effects of other treatments.\n\nRemember, the goal is to prevent long term damage to your liver from Hep B and reduce risk of liver cancer. Be open with your concerns to your doctors and they'll surely help you to reach the best decision for your health situation.",
    "693": "Yes, I would agree with your doctor's plan. Mobic (or Meloxicam) can help alleviate pain and inflammation caused by arthritis or other similar conditions. If your symptoms don't improve, an MRI can reveal more about the soft tissue structures in your knee (such as cartilage, tendons, and ligaments), which can be damaged even if your bones appear okay on X-ray. Depending on those results, a consultation with an orthopedic doctor might be necessary. \n\nIn the meantime, it could also be helpful to avoid activities that stress your knees, if possible, and to try low-impact exercises to strengthen the muscles that support your knees. Physical therapy might also be beneficial. Always ensure to take medication as prescribed and not overdo physical activities. It's important to give your body rest to heal.",
    "694": "Hello, Micronor is a progestin-only contraceptive pill, and while it doesn't typically cause the symptoms you're describing, everyone's body can react differently to medication. The symptoms you're experiencing may be due to an unrelated health issue, or they could potentially represent a rare side effect of the medication. I would recommend that you speak to your doctor about this. They can help determine whether or not the medication you're taking is responsible for your symptoms, and they can also check for other potential causes.",
    "695": "The smelly white cheesy bumps you're describing sound like they could be sebaceous cysts, which are blocked sweat glands that become filled with sebum, a greasy material produced by the skin. Once these cysts rupture, they can be prone to infection. The discharge from these cysts can be odorous and appear white and cheesy. \n\nHowever, your mother's coldness and shortness of breath is concerning. These aren't typical reactions to cyst drainage, and could suggest that she's having a reaction to the procedure or that an infection has spread, causing systemic effects. \n\nGiven her symptoms, I highly recommend getting your mother to see her doctor or to a hospital as soon as possible to evaluate her condition further. In the future, It's advised not to pop these at home and consult a healthcare professional instead to avoid the risk of infections or complications.\n",
    "696": "Hello, from your description, it sounds like your son might have Molluscum Contagiosum. It's a viral infection that causes small, painless bumps on the skin. The bumps are generally small and either white, pink, or skin-colored. \n\nThe seizures and autism, and the medications for them, shouldn't have any effect on this condition. \n\nHowever, please keep in mind that it's important to have a through examination in-person by a healthcare provider to confirm this diagnosis. If it is Molluscum Contagiosum, it usually gets better on its own over time, but a doctor may suggest treatments to speed up the recovery process. \n\nI definitely recommend you reach out to your son's pediatrician or a dermatologist for a complete examination.",
    "697": "Hi, with the symptoms you've described and the timeline, it's possible that you might be pregnant. A home pregnancy test is usually best taken at least a week after a missed period to ensure accuracy, so you may take one now since you're 4 days late. Keep in mind that while these tests are generally accurate, a blood test administered by a healthcare professional is the most accurate. If you do take a home pregnancy test and it is negative, I would recommend following up with your doctor since your symptoms persist. It could be possible these symptoms are due to a hormonal imbalance or other medical condition.",
    "698": "Hi there, I am sorry to hear about your recurrent episodes. These episodes of loss of consciousness with other associated symptoms may be due to a number of reasons such as low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), low blood pressure (hypotension), seizures, or heart-related issues (cardiac arrhythmia). Of course we should not overlook the possibility of stress, dehydration, or inadequate sleep causing such conditions. Given that you suffered a significant injury during your last episode, it's crucial to get a proper evaluation done. Please see a physician as soon as possible, who may be able to guide you towards the right specialist (neurologist, cardiologist etc) depending on the cause suspected. The doctor may ask for some blood tests, EKG, EEG, CT/MRI etc to find out the cause of these episodes. Don't delay your visit to the doctor.",
    "699": "I'm sorry to hear you are still experiencing pain. Recovery from spinal fusions tends to be variable depending on various factors including the extent of fusion, individual's health status, associated complications, etc. Generally, the acute pain gent improves in a few weeks, but it may take several months to a year for a complete recovery, especially when it comes to resuming all activities. \n\nYour persistent pain might be due to slow healing or postoperative nerve inflammation or irritation. However, this wouldn’t usually prevent getting out of bed or rolling over. It might be worth discussing with your doctor about more aggressive pain management or possibly physical therapy to assist you during this recovery time. \n\nIncrease your activities gradually as tolerated. Make sure you avoid any lifting, twisting or bending at your waist anytime soon. Please do not hesitate to seek healthcare if your pain continues to be uncontrollable or your condition deteriorates.",
    "701": "It's safe for wisdom teeth to be removed in a dental office under anesthesia, as long as the dentist is trained and skilled in anesthesia. Oral surgeons and many general dentists receive extensive training in anesthesia during their post-graduate education. However, who is doing the administering of the anesthesia is important, hence the need for a qualified anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist. \n\nSome consider oral surgeons to have more experience and training in the surgical removal of wisdom teeth compared to general dentists, especially if complications arise. Complications could include impacted wisdom teeth, the patient's health history, the desire for general versus local anesthesia, and the number of wisdom teeth to be removed. Oral surgeons are trained to administer all levels of sedation, including general anesthesia.\n\nThe patient (or their guardian) should feel comfortable asking about the dentist's or oral surgeon's training and experience with the procedure and sedation. If there is any concern, then seeking a second opinion with an oral surgeon can be a good idea. \n\nTo summarize, both a general dentist and an oral surgeon can safely remove wisdom teeth as long as they are properly trained. It depends on the complexity of the extraction and the sedation desired by the patient. If the wisdom teeth are impacted or other complexities are present, it may be safer to use an oral surgeon. If the wisdom teeth are fully erupted and there are no complexities, then a general dentist would be acceptable and typically more economical.",

    "703": "Hello, the painful lump you are describing under your nipple could possibly be an infection, particularly if you also have open sores or wounds in that area. There also might be a possibility of gynecomastia, a condition that causes breast tissue to swell in males due to hormone imbalances, though it typically involves both breasts. Another possibility could be a rare form of breast cancer. Men can get breast cancer, though it is very rare. It's crucial that you see your GP or a surgeon as soon as possible for a physical evaluation. He or she may need to prescribe you antibiotics, order imaging tests like an ultrasound or mammogram, or they might consider a biopsy if deemed necessary. Please note that it is important to seek medical attention right away, especially since the lump is causing you pain and there are open wounds. This is not an emergency, but should be taken care of promptly.",
    "704": "Hello, it sounds like you may be dealing with a recurrent skin condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. This condition is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that presents as recurrent, painful, boil-like lumps (abscesses) and scarring in the areas of the body where sweat glands (apocrine glands) are present, including the groin and underarms. \n\nWhen they rupture, these abscesses can discharge pus that has an unpleasant odor. The abscesses often become painful and later rupture to drain an unpleasant-smelling pus. Over time, these areas can produce fibrosis (scar tissue) and sinus tracts that lead to further abscesses.\n\nManagement often involves lifestyle changes: lose weight if overweight, quit smoking, wear loose-fitting clothes, and good hygiene. When flares occur, a course of antibiotics might be helpful. Topical clindamycin is the most commonly used one. For more severe cases, long-term antibiotics or biologics might be options. \n\nSurgery might be needed in serious or recurring cases. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic condition but can often be well-controlled with management.\n\nAs this condition can also be associated with other health issues and complications, it's important to have a discussion and evaluation with a healthcare provider. Please schedule an appointment with a dermatologist for a physical examination and to discuss treatment options.",
    "705": "The symptoms your grandmother is experiencing could be due to a variety of conditions, not necessarily related to her heart or stent. They might be linked to her blood sugar level fluctuations or nerve-related problems. If she is not having any kind of chest pain, breathlessness, or other heart-related symptoms, it's unlikely that the stent is causing this issue.\n\nStill, it's essential to monitor her blood sugar and blood pressure levels regularly, as uncontrolled sugar and BP can lead to complications. Your grandmother should be under the care of a primary physician for these conditions.\n\nSeeing a doctor in person would be advisable for her to have an overall check-up and to address the specific problem you mentioned. They might want to conduct some tests or adjust your grandmother's medication regimen to manage her symptoms better.\n\nRemember, while technology can provide useful insights, it's always better to consult a healthcare provider directly about health concerns. As a doctor, I can offer advice based on the information provided but can not replace a personal consultation with a physician.\n\nIf you have further questions, feel free to ask!",
    "706": "I'm sorry to hear about your son's recurring fevers. It's definitely concerning. It may be due to a persistent infection or it could be a result of something else entirely. Because the fevers have been recurring for over a month, it's necessary to get a thorough evaluation done as soon as possible. Please take him to see a pediatrician urgently. They may need to run some blood tests to understand the cause of these consistent fevers. In the meantime, continue to monitor his temperature, keep him hydrated, and ensure he gets plenty of rest. Get medical attention immediately if he seems excessively sleepy, irritable, has trouble breathing or experiences a seizure. It would also be helpful to maintain a record of his temperature readings throughout the day to share with the doctor.",
    "707": "Hi, it sounds like you're going through a stressful time and I understand your concerns. Your symptoms could indeed be related to stress, but they could also be related to conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), given your family history. \n\nThe presence of bloody mucus in the stool is a concern and should not be ignored. While it can occur in benign conditions such as hemorrhoids, it can also be a symptom of more serious conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer. \n\nWithout a physical examination and further testing, it's hard for me to say what the cause is. I would recommend you discuss these symptoms and your concerns with your doctor. Given your symptoms and family history, it would be reasonable to consider a colonoscopy.\n\nRemember, colon cancer is relatively rare in young people especially without a family history, and it is much more likely that your symptoms are due to a less serious condition like IBS or gastritis. However, only a doctor who reviews your physical health, history and the needed tests can give you the definitive answer. Please schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider as soon as possible. \n\nAlso, it's important to continue with your treatment for depression and follow your doctor's instructions concerning your mental health. Stress and anxiety can manifest in physical symptoms and proper management can help alleviate these symptoms.",
    "708": "I'm sorry to hear about your situation. Small cell lung cancer is usually aggressive and often becomes resistant to chemotherapy over time. However, it also often responds well initially to chemotherapy, which may explain the clear scan you had previously. The return of the cancer indicates that a few cancer cells survived somewhere in your body and started to grow again. \n\nAt this stage, your treatment options could include chemotherapy again (potentially with different drugs), immunotherapy (drugs that target particular features of the cancer cells), or targeted radiation therapy for the specific tumors.\n\nUnfortunately, overall survival rates for recurrent small cell lung cancer are not high, and it can be especially challenging given your case that includes COPD and the need for continuous oxygen. However, everyone is different, and treatments can sometimes control the cancer for a long time. \n\nRemember to always discuss these issues with your doctor. They will have the most accurate information for your exact situation. Try to find a balance between active treatment and maintaining the best quality of life possible. This is something you can decide only in conversation with your medical team and your loved ones.",
    "709": "Hello Maria, given your age and the x-ray results, it's possible that the pain could be from osteoarthritis in your knee or hip. While you mention not having pain in the hips specifically, referred pain from hip arthritis can sometimes cause pain in the knee and leg. It's also possible that the knee joint damage itself is causing the pain down your leg. I would recommend meeting with your doctor or a specialist, perhaps a rheumatologist or an orthopedic specialist, to help understand and manage your pain better. Physical therapy may also benefit you, as strengthening the muscles around the joints can help relieve some of the discomfort. Pain management options might include over-the-counter pain relievers, topical creams, or stronger medications if needed. Discuss these options in depth with your healthcare provider to find the best solution for your individual situation.",
    "710": "Hi, given your description of the fall and your increasing pain, edema, and bruising, I would strongly recommend that you go to the ER. Although it may be a challenge with your children, your health is a priority. It's possible that you may have fractured or severely sprained your ankle. If not treated promptly, it may lead to further complications. You may also have injured your shoulder and knees, which also need to be assessed. Therefore, it is critical that you have your injuries appropriately diagnosed by a healthcare professional.",
    "711": "I'm sorry to hear you're still experiencing chest pain. Although your cardiac tests are normal, it's clear that your pain persists. To clarify whether the esomeprazole is helping, think about whether the pain seems to occur when your stomach is empty or soon after eating - this could indicate reflux or another gastrointestinal problem, which esomeprazole may help with. If it is not helping, it is possible that the pain may be arising from your chest wall or from muscular tension. If you've been under any particular stress or anxiety recently, these could certainly be contributing factors. \n\nPracticing relaxation techniques or exercises like yoga can sometimes help. Applying heat to the area or using over-the-counter painkillers when it hurts may also provide some relief.\n\nLastly, if the pain continues, do contact your healthcare provider again for further evaluation--never neglect persistent chest pain. Always err on the side of caution and make sure you're taking care of yourself the best you can.",

By itself, horseshoe kidney does not cause any medical problems, but it can increase the chances of developing kidney stones, infections, or blockage of urine flow. It's important to manage these potential issues for maintaining kidney health.\n\nIn the context of his boxing career, the main concern would be any trauma or injury to the abdomen that might affect the kidney. Therefore, this needs to be discussed with your son's urologist or pediatrician and maybe even a sports medicine doctor to assess the risks accurately. \n\nIt would be upon the assessment of these medical professionals whether they feel he could continue boxing. It doesn't automatically exclude him from sports activities, but precautions should be taken. It's crucial to express your son's passion for boxing and discuss the steps you could take to reduce the potential risks.",
    "713": "Hello, you can safely transition from the Evra patch to Cerazette (which is a progestin-only pill). If you start Cerazette on the day you would apply your next patch, you will have continuous contraceptive protection and no need for additional methods (like condoms). If you switch at any other time, you should use a backup contraceptive method for the first 48 hours of Cerazette use, just to ensure you're covered.\n\nWhile both methods are generally well tolerated, please be aware that Cerazette can sometimes lead to changes in menstrual patterns, including spotting, irregular or missed periods. Other potential side effects include breast tenderness, weight gain, or mood changes. As with any new medication, if you notice any new or concerning side effects, reach out to your healthcare provider. \n\nIn addition, Cerazette needs to be taken at the same time every day, whereas the patch offers a little more flexibility. This might require some adjustment in your daily routine. \n\nLastly, it's always a good idea to have a discussion with your healthcare provider before changing contraceptives, to ensure it's the best decision for your individual health circumstances.",
    "714": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your discomfort. This severe headache might be caused by a number of conditions including tension headache, migraines, cluster headaches or perhaps even sinusitis, given the fact that the pain extends to your forehead. Your frequent burping could be due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which could potentially lead to a headache as well. Since the medication prescribed by your doctor isn't helping, it's crucial to schedule a follow-up appointment for further evaluation. They might need to change your medication or dig a bit deeper into your symptoms with additional diagnostic tests. In the meantime, try to avoid any triggers that might worsen your headache which could include stress, certain food, lack of sleep, etc. Caffeine might relieve some of your headache pain temporarily. Also try to eat smaller meals to reduce bloating and burping. Keeping a headache and food diary might be helpful to discern any specific triggers. Remember to share that with your doctor too.

Having a liver transplant carries some risks, both due to the operation itself and the medication needed to prevent rejection of the donor’s liver after the transplant. The surgical risks include bleeding, infection and complications from general anaesthesia. \n\nIn adults who donate a portion of their liver, the risks associated with the surgery include infection, bleeding, liver failure, complications from general anesthesia, and at rare occasions, death. However, most adult donors have a relatively uneventful recovery and in the majority of reported living donor cases, donors have returned to their regular lifestyles without significant lasting effects.\n\nThe liver is a unique organ in that it's the only one in the body that can regrow, or regenerate, after part of it is removed.

    "717": "Hello. It sounds like you're describing a phenomenon that's actually quite normal. When a man is aroused, his body typically produces a substance called pre-ejaculate or \"pre-cum\". This is a clear, sticky fluid that's released from the penis when sexually aroused but before ejaculation. It's the body's way of preparing for sexual intercourse. What you're experiencing is simply a physiological response to sexual thoughts or excitement. There's no way to stop your body from producing pre-ejaculate completely, but you might find these strategies helpful:\n\n1. Practice \"emotional regulation.\" This is a way of controlling your responses to certain situations. It might involve deep breathing techniques, mindfulness, or other strategies to reduce your overall level of arousal.\n\n2. Wear thicker, more absorbent underwear. This may help to contain any pre-ejaculate so you don't feel as uncomfortable.\n\n3. Avoid explicit sexual dialogue or thoughts if you can.\n\nRemember, this is a normal part of male sexual response and nothing to be ashamed of. However, if it continues to bother you, it would be a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional for advice.\n",

Fibromyalgia can also cause chronic pain and tenderness in muscles and joints. The hard and sore tendons in your hands could be related to repeated use or maybe a condition called tendonitis, common in people with diabetes. The changes in your thyroid function, from underactive to overactive, would certainly need a close follow-up, as it could also be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nAt this point, what you need is a comprehensive management approach involving a good control of your diabetes, thyroid issues, and proper treatment for your fibromyalgia.

It would be important to clarify what specifically was seen on the X-ray - whether it was a fluid-filled space, a lesion, or simply an artifact. If you can provide more details, I may be able to guide you better. \n\nSymptoms like these can be due to several medical conditions that affect the heart, lungs, or even gastrointestinal system. It could be due to a condition called Pleural effusion (where there is accumulation of fluid in the chest cavity), a lung condition, myocardial infraction or something related to the esophagus. \n\nThe exact diet would also depend on the actual diagnosis.

Regular exercise is also beneficial, as is avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. \n\nI highly recommend you to discuss this with a cardiologist for a thorough evaluation and guidance. Also, an updated diagnostic test may be needed if it has been a while since the last one.

Your situation is complex due to your anatomical abnormality - the double ureter - and your recurrent, resistant urinary tract infections. The possibility of reflux due to your double ureter does make sense. When this happens, urine can flow back up into the kidneys from the bladder, which can lead to infection. \n\nYou might benefit from a procedure called ureteral reimplantation surgery - where the ureter is reattached to the bladder in a way that helps prevent reflux. However, surgery always comes with its own risks, so it would need to be carefully considered.\n\nYou also could consider getting a second (or third) opinion from another specialist, such as a urologist who specializes in anatomical abnormalities or a nephrologist. \n\nFinally, ensuring you are taking all best measures to prevent UTIs can be beneficial. This includes proper hygiene, staying well-hydrated, urinating before and after intercourse, avoiding irritating substances (like harsh soaps or douches), and potentially using a prophylactic (preventative) antibiotic if that's deemed appropriate by your provider. \n\nI understand how exhausting and frustrating it must be to continually deal with these infections and all the treatments.

It appears you have a form of arthritis, possibly Osteoarthritis or a non-seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis (which means the blood test could be negative but you may still suffer from the disease). These conditions can cause synovial inflammation and fluid build-up. Some people do note that their joints react to changes in the weather, so it is possible, but it's not something that is fully understood. I would recommend seeing a Rheumatologist who could further study your case. Physical therapy, exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knee, and maintain your range of motion, as well as over-the-counter NSAIDs, may be recommended by your doctor to ease swelling and pain.",
    "727": "Hello Mrs. John, \n\nFirstly, I'm glad to hear that you're taking active steps in managing your diabetes! \n\nNow, on to your shoulder pain. Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a common cause of shoulder pain and restriction in people your age, especially in diabetics. Symptoms generally come on gradually and may worsen at night. This could indeed be a possible diagnosis if you're experiencing a decrease in your range of movement alongside the pain. \n\nUrine therapy is a non-traditional method that some people use for various ailments - it's not scientifically backed up as a treatment for a lot of conditions, including frozen shoulder. \n\nPhysiotherapy, on the other hand, is a proven method to both manage pain and improve range of motion in a lot of musculoskeletal conditions, including frozen shoulder. It might cause some discomfort, but it's generally not described as painful. \n\nBefore you decide the course of action, I would highly recommend that you consult a healthcare professional to properly assess your shoulder and give a definitive diagnosis. With a correct diagnosis, you can get treated appropriately and quickly. I hope you find relief from your shoulder pain soon. Take care!",
    "728": "Hello, Using steroids can cause testicular shrinkage because they stop the body from producing testosterone. When the body is getting external testosterone, it sends a signal to the testicles to stop making their own, causing them to shrink over time. This can potentially lead to a decrease in sperm production and therefore might be reducing your fertility.\n\nIn your case, if you've stopped injecting the steroids, your body should normalize its testosterone production over time, and once that happens, your testicles may regain their natural size and potentially restore normal sperm production. This process can take several months.\n\nHowever, I would recommend seeing a doctor to assess the current state of your fertility if you're concerned about availing children. They may order a semen analysis to determine your sperm count and other fertility factors. Please discuss this with a healthcare provider. Always remember it is important not to use steroids needlessly and without the supervision of a medical professional due to their potentially serious side effects, including on fertility. \n\nI hope this information helps. Let me know if you have any other questions. Take care.",
    "729": "Hello, it sounds like your son is experiencing multiple symptoms which could be interrelated, but can also represent different conditions. \n\n1. Chest pain in an asthmatic child could be due to muscle strain from coughing or may indicate worsening asthma. If the chest pain occurs while exercising, it might be indicative of exercise-induced asthma. \n\n2. Pain in ankles and headaches might be unrelated to the asthma. Pain in ankles could be due to overuse or minor injuries. However, persistent pain warrants further investigation to rule out growing pains, juvenile arthritis, etc. Regarding headaches, they can often be caused by dehydration, minor illnesses like a cold, stress, or eye strain.\n\n3. Difficulty in swallowing may indicate a potentially serious condition like esophagitis, which can be associated with GERD or infections. \n\nI would highly recommend taking your son to his pediatrician, who knows his medical history better in order to evaluate his symptoms holistically and refer to the necessary specialists, if required. Remember to effectively use his asthma action plan to manage his asthma symptoms. All the best!",
    "730": "The symptoms you described sound like they could be associated with a condition called fibromyalgia or potentially Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Both of these conditions are characterized by chronic fatigue, muscle pain, and sleep disturbances. Brain fog, or the feeling of being in a mental fog, is also common. The causes of fibromyalgia and CFS are not well understood and can thus often take time to diagnose correctly. In the meantime, it is important to manage your symptoms effectively. You may benefit from a combination of medication for pain relief and physical therapy for improving joint flexibility and strength. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can also be effective in managing the impact of fatigue and chronic pain on your mental wellbeing. A sleep study might also be beneficial, as improving the quality of your sleep could help to alleviate some of your symptoms. Regular exercise, while difficult due to your fatigue, can over time help to reduce fatigue and improve sleep. I would urge you to follow up with a rheumatologist, they specialize in conditions like fibromyalgia. If you're having vision issues, you should also see an ophthalmologist as your vision changes may not be related to fibromyalgia or CFS and deserve attention in their own right.",
    "731": "Hello, thank you for your query. Tuberculosis once healed does often leave scar tissues which will appear on X-rays. These are inactive, and non-infectious lesions. If you have no symptoms like cough, fever, weight loss etc., it usually means there's no active disease. However, some countries, especially in the Middle East, have strict rules regarding past pulmonary tuberculosis, even if it was treated and cured.\n\nIf you want to return to UAE, I advise you to consult with a pulmonologist and get done a CT thorax and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis. A bronchoscopy with BAL analysis is more accurate in diagnosing ongoing/infectious tuberculosis. If both of these tests are negative for tuberculosis, you can make an appeal to the authorities in UAE that your lesions on chest x-ray are old, healed, inactive lesion, not infectious and you're not a threat to public health.\n\nIt is important to ensure that you do not have an active TB infection before you consider reapplying for work in the UAE or in any other country with similar restrictions. This situation needs to be handled by a medical professional who is familiar with these matters and guided by the results of the diagnostic tests and examinations. Please consult your doctor to discuss further. Thanks.",
    "732": "Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor. It seems like your Gynaecologist is considering the possibility of an ovarian cyst or an ovarian condition giving your symptoms and an elevated CA 125. This is a blood test often done in women who may have an ovarian cyst or an ovarian tumour. It is NOT specific for cancer and can be elevated in benign (non-cancerous) conditions like endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, fibroids and also in some benign ovarian cysts. Right now, it does not mean necessarily that you have a malignant condition but your doctor is doing the right thing by investigating you further after an elevation in the CA 125 test. You should get an URGENT ultrasound done which would give a clearer picture of what's happening. It may guide the gynaecologist to take a decision whether any further steps such as a CT scan or a surgical intervention is required. Do keep in mind that at your age, ovarian cancer is rare. All the best.",
    "733": "Hello, \nYes, it is possible for a gallstone to pass into the common bile duct. This is known as choledocholithiasis. When this occurs, it can block the flow of bile into the intestine, which can lead to jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes, and dark yellow urine). This is usually accompanied by severe abdominal pain. If this is the case, it's considered a medical emergency and requires prompt evaluation and treatment, often involving a procedure to remove the stone from the bile duct. \n\nIt's important to note that not all cases of yellow urine or slight yellowing of the eyes after a gallbladder attack indicate this condition. It could also be due to the liver processing the aftermath of the gallbladder attack, causing a temporary increase in bilirubin levels.\n\nHowever, given that jaundice can indicate several potentially serious conditions, I recommend you to seek immediate medical attention if you notice these symptoms. Your healthcare provider can conduct the appropriate tests to determine the exact cause and initiate the correct treatment.",
    "734": "Hello, Thanks for your query on Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. In your case, the increase in SGPT and SGOT and the viral load shows that Hepatitis B is again multiplying in your body and causing liver inflammation. This is not a favorable sign. You need to see your doctor as soon as possible. You might need change of medicines or addition of another medicine. You need to take care of your diet. Avoid any alcohol or unnecessary medications especially painkillers. Include lots of fruits and vegetables in your diet. Avoid high protein diet. Get well Soon. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if you need any more assistance. Good luck.\n",
    "735": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your persistent cough. Based on what you've described, it's likely that you may be dealing with an issue such as bronchitis or possibly something more chronic like asthma, especially given your history of wheezing and difficulty breathing. Eosinophilic bronchitis could also produce similar symptoms. The color of the mucus can potentially point towards an infection, but often a clear or white color simply indicates mucus from the respiratory tract.\n\nIt might be worthwhile to revisit the doctor to get this checked out further. A pulmonary function test might help characterize the nature of your breathing trouble and the cause of your cough. In the meantime, make sure you are staying hydrated and using over-the-counter cough suppressants if allowable and not contraindicated for you. Taking a hot shower can help to break up the mucus and allow you to cough it out more easily.\n\nAside from these, if you are a smoker, consider quitting as it can aggravate the cough. If you have any known allergies, try to avoid those allergens as much as possible. Until you get to see a doctor, make sure you rest, stay hydrated, maintain a balanced diet, and use over-the-counter methods to control your symptoms.",
    "736": "Hi, I understand your concern. Based on your symptoms, it could be a cyst or possibly a mucocele, which is a common cystic lesion of the oral cavity that results from the accumulation of saliva in the connective tissue due to a rupture in the salivary gland duct. However, it could also be some other type of benign growth, or possibly due to an injury, infection, or an allergic reaction. \n\nIt's advisable to get it checked by a healthcare professional as it's been persisting for a few days now. They may need to examine it or do some tests for an accurate diagnosis. Meanwhile, continue with the cold compresses, and try not to poke or squeeze the lump. \n\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions. Please remember that my diagnosis is based purely on the symptoms you have told me, and a face-to-face consultation would yield a more accurate diagnosis. \n\nEat healthy, keep hydrated, and get proper rest. Take care.",
    "737": "Hi, It's important to ensure that a potential kidney donor is in the best possible health and doesn't carry any risk of developing kidney disease in the future. When it comes to creatinine levels, they are an indication of kidney function. If a person has low creatinine levels, it usually means their kidneys are functioning well. However, in some rare cases, it could also indicate a muscle disease, which is likely the concern here. \n\nRegarding your second question, there would be no medications to maintain a \"constant\" creatinine level following kidney donation. The remaining kidney does naturally adjust and increase its filtration rate to compensate for the loss of the other kidney. Doctors closely monitor kidney donors after the procedure to ensure the remaining kidney is functioning well. Essentially, the health experts making this decision are erring on the side of caution to ensure the donor's long-term health isn't compromised. It's admirable that your friend is willing to donate, but it's critical to prioritize the health of both parties involved.",
    "738": "It's concerning that your child's cough has persisted for over 8 weeks even after a round of antibiotics. It's possible that the lingering cough is due to post-infection inflammation or an additional illness, but with such a long duration, it would be advisable to go back to the doctor for a re-evaluation. It would be especially important to rule out conditions like asthma or a prolonged respiratory tract infection. Your son's silent reflux can also contribute to cough, so managing this could improve his symptoms. I recommend you try to encourage him to cough up the mucus instead of swallowing it back down, as this will also help alleviate the cough. Please seek medical attention as soon as possible just in case it's something more serious.",
    "739": "High blood pressure can be a lifelong condition, and often times it is controlled through medication like LOSAR A, which is a combination of losartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker) and amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker), both used to lower blood pressure. Regarding continuation, it often depends on your overall health, lifestyle and concurrent conditions. Some people can manage or lower their blood pressure levels by lifestyle changes including regular exercise, healthy diet, reducing salt and alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight. But for others, medication is necessary to control high blood pressure.\n\nIt's important to note that stopping medication suddenly without consulting your doctor may lead to a dangerous spike in blood pressure. So if you'd wish to make any changes, it's best to discuss with your doctor.\n\nAs far as side effects, most blood pressure medications are well tolerated, but like all medications, they can have side effects. Common side effects include dizziness, feeling tired, stomach upset, or ankle swelling. However, not everyone experiences side effects, and many people use these medications without any problems. If you begin to have side effects, you should contact your doctor right away.",
    "740": "Hello. Streptococcus Agalactiae, also known as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a common bacteria that can be found in the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and genital area of adults. Pregnant women can pass GBS to their newborns during delivery, which can lead to infections in the newborn. It's also possible, although not common, for adults to spread GBS to each other, particularly through sexual contact.\n\nAlthough GBS is a common bacteria, it's not likely that you picked it up from swimming in the ocean or a pool. More likely, the bacteria has been in your body for a while and has become problematic only recently, perhaps due to a weakened immune system or another trigger.\n\nAs for your treatment, Azithromycin (Z-pack) is generally effective against many types of bacteria, but it might not be the best choice for treating a GBS infection. A better option might be Penicillin or Amoxicillin, which are known to be effective against GBS. It's important to discuss this with your doctor. \n\nFinally, while GBS can be passed to others, especially newborns, it's not generally considered highly contagious among healthy adults. Still, it's a good idea to practice good hygiene, including frequent handwashing, to reduce the chance of spreading any infection.\n\nAlways, when in doubt, reaching out to your physician for clarification would be helpful.",
    "742": "Hello Kate, I'm sorry to hear about the symptoms you're experiencing. I understand your concern for a potential acoustic neuroma or cyst, both of which can present with dizziness and hearing problems. Without your MRI pictures and detailed reports it's difficult to provide a detailed interpretation. However, an acoustic neuroma would typically show as a mass at the internal auditory canal on the MRI and would likely explain your symptoms of tinnitus, vertigo and balance problems. Please follow up with your neurologist or ENT specialist with the full details of your symptoms, as the pictures alone may not give the complete picture. It's also important to consider other potential causes such as migraines, which are common in people your age and can also present with daily headaches and nausea. You may want to discuss these possibilities with your doctor. Stay strong and remember that there are many potential treatments for these conditions.",
    "743": "Hello, post-surgical recovery can take time and it's not unusual to feel discomfort or even new pains after such procedures. The sharp groin pain and foot spasm you described could be related to the manipulation of nerves during surgery, or due to nerve inflammation. The grinding pain might be due to weakened or strained back muscles after surgery. \n\nIt's important to bring all these to the attention of your surgeon, because they will need to reassess your situation and see whether any further intervention is necessary. It's possible that the foot spasm might require treatment involving medications to control muscle spasms or nerve pain. Also suitable physiotherapy might accelerate the recovery process by strengthening your back muscles and promoting spine stability. \n\nPlease don't ignore these symptoms and get advice from your healthcare provider as soon as possible.",
    "744": "Hello, It's concerning to hear that your young son is having such issues. Without the ability to examine him personally, it's difficult to provide specific advice. However, from the information you have shared, it's clear that professional medical consultation is warranted. \n\nIn some cases of severe allergies, a doctor may recommend antihistamines even for young children, but that should strictly be done under doctor supervision. As a temporary measure, a humidifier in the room may help ease the congestion, making it easier for him to breathe and sleep. \n\nCovering mattresses and pillows with dust-mite-proof covers, and washing bedding in hot water weekly can also help. If allergens are the cause, regular cleaning of your home and eliminating any dust collecting items can also make a difference. \n\nPlease make sure your son is seen by a healthcare provider, preferably a pediatrician or allergist, who can provide the most accurate recommendations based on a full examination. Best of luck, and I hope your son feels better soon.",
    "745": "Hello, I understand your concern. Such post-menopausal bleeding, even if it's light, should always be evaluated to rule out any serious issues. Although it could be a side effect from the Prednisone, we cannot be sure without an examination. Prednisone can sometimes cause hormonal fluctuations, which might lead to some spotting or light bleeding. But in your case, it's best to consult with a gynecologist for a thorough evaluation to ensure that the cause of bleeding is not something serious like endometrial cancer. Any bleeding after menopause is considered abnormal and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible.",
    "746": "This is concerning. A rash after taking amoxicillin can definitely be an allergic reaction, and Benadryl is usually adequate to help with this. However, if the rash on her legs is turning black, this could potentially be a sign of a more serious reaction. It could indicate tissue damage or infection. \n\nI strongly recommend seeking immediate medical attention. Do not delay in getting her to an Emergency Department. This needs to be evaluated as soon as possible. Black discoloration is not a typical reaction from a drug allergy, and needs to be evaluated immediately to prevent potential complications. \n\nPlease remember that this advice is meant to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your child's individual situation. Always consult with your child's personal physician for more information.",
    "747": "Your child's symptoms do suggest a possible gastrointestinal issue and considering his family history of stomach and bowel cancer, it is advisable to get him thoroughly evaluated. However, keep in mind that it's extremely rare for a child as young as your son to have serious issues like cancer.\n\nGiven the symptoms you've mentioned - recurrent stomach pains, weight loss, pale and loose stools - these could be indicative of malabsorption disorders like celiac disease or possibly an issue with his pancreas or liver. It could also indicate inflammatory bowel disease, although this is less common in children his age. Mesenteric adenitis typically causes temporary pain and is usually caused by an infection. A complete blood work up (including liver function tests and complete blood count), stool tests, and possibly an ultrasound of his abdomen would be initial steps.\n\nRegarding the possibility of a viral infection like hepatitis, it is always a consideration, especially if he is having pale or clay-colored stools and loss of appetite. Hepatitis A, for instance, can sometimes occur in children and presents with such symptoms.\n\nIt's important to talk to his pediatrician about these possibilities and to arrange the necessary tests. Meanwhile, maintain a good hand hygiene to prevent the spread of potential infections, and continue with a balanced diet to support his immunity as much as possible. Note down his symptoms, as detailed information can be helpful for the doctor in making diagnosis.",
    "748": "I'm really sorry to hear about the pain you're experiencing. This intense, sharp pain on one side, especially if it's different from your typical pain or has increased dramatically, may be a sign of an irritated or compressed nerve which needs immediate management. It could be due to further herniation or inflammation around the disc. If the pain is unbearable or if you develop any loss of sensation, lower limb weakness, or any problems controlling your bladder or bowel, I would advise you to visit the emergency department as soon as possible. If it doesn't improve at all over the next day or so, you may want to see if there's earlier appointment availability with your pain management doctor, or consider seeing your primary care doctor or another available healthcare provider in the meantime. They can potentially look into different or additional pain medications, physical therapy, or other treatments. Please do not take this advice lightly and I hope you can find relief soon.",

They are often incidentally found during imaging tests for other conditions, as seems to have been the case with you. \n\nIf the cyst hasn't changed in size, and you're not experiencing any symptoms such as cough, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, your doctor may suggest simply monitoring the cyst at regular intervals with imaging tests. \n\nHowever, in some cases, if the cyst is causing discomfort or if there is any concern it may be something more serious, it may be surgically removed for definitive testing.\n\nI strongly recommend you to consult with your doctor about the next steps, considering your specific case and medical history. The doctor will help you to decide the best course of action. Please, don't hesitate to ask any more questions if you have!",
    "750": "Hi, thank you for your question. Based on your description, it sounds like you have been able to conceive previously which is a good sign. The abdominal and thigh pain you described could be related to the abortion you had, especially if it was recent. It could also be a symptom of other issues such as an ovarian cyst or endometriosis, so it would be best to have this checked out by your doctor if the pain continues. \n\nAs for your endometrium size of 6mm, this can vary throughout your cycle and usually thickens in preparation for pregnancy. If your doctor has concerns about this, they may suggest estrogen supplements or other treatments to help thicken your endometrial lining. It's hard to say for sure whether you will be able to get pregnant again without knowing more about your specific situation, but many women with similar issues have been able to conceive with the right treatment. I recommend continuing to work with your gynecologist to develop the best plan for you. Best of luck!",

While it's possible the injury could improve over time, it's better to err on the side of caution and have it evaluated sooner rather than later to ensure appropriate treatment.",
    "752": "Given your previous history of a complete right ankle dislocation, your current symptoms might indicate residual effects post-trauma, or possibly the development of post-traumatic arthritis. The pain in your left lower leg could be due to overcompensation for the right ankle's lack of mobility. \n\nI would recommend visiting an orthopedic specialist for a complete evaluation. This might include a physical examination, imaging studies like an X-ray or MRI to evaluate the current state of your right ankle, and possibly gait analysis. Depending on the findings, treatment options could range from conservative management (like physiotherapy and pain management) to surgical interventions for improving the ankle's mobility. \n\nRest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE protocol) can be useful for managing your symptoms in the meantime. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be used for symptom relief, if not contraindicated. \n\nThe consultation with the orthopedic specialist is important as this will ensure a thorough evaluation and more targeted treatment plan, necessary for your case, is set into play.",

Teeth development can also contribute to this. Make sure that she gets a balanced diet rich in proteins and vitamins to further strengthen her immune system. It's very common for children to go through these phases. You might try some new foods because it might just be that she's bored with the regular ones. Try introducing fruits, yoghurt or replacing rice with mashed potatoes. It's okay for her to be fussy at this age. Just monitor her weight and make sure that she is active, responsive, and does not have any signs of malnourishment. If her weight keep declining, I suggest consulting with a pediatrician.\n",
    "755": "Hello,\n\nWhat you're experiencing is perfectly normal and is no cause for alarm. The leakage that you notice during sleep, also known as a noctural emission or 'wet dream', is a normal physiological response, especially when one abstains from ejaculation for a while. It's the body's natural way of eliminating excess semen.\n\nSimilarly, the \"leakage\" you experience when speaking with your girlfriend is also normal, it's known as pre-ejaculate or \"pre-cum\". It occurs in response to sexual arousal and is meant to lubricate and prepare for sexual intercourse. \n\nSo, these are natural processes and not a disease or condition that needs to be treated. If it is causing significant distress, consider speaking with a healthcare provider or a counselor who specializes in sexual health to help manage these experiences better. However, there is nothing unhealthy about these responses, and they do not pose a risk to your sexual health or overall well-being. \n\nTo maintain overall good health: \n- Try to eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n- Get regular physical activity. \n- Try to get adequate sleep.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.",

This could be the result of a number of possible conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, etc. It could also occur as part of aging. The important fact is to correlate it with your symptoms. As for your symptoms, the cause could be migraines or tension-type headaches. These are benign but disabling conditions. Medication, physiotherapy, lifestyle changes, and sometimes counseling or cognitive behavioral therapy are typically used to treat these conditions. If the headaches are becoming more frequent or severe, or are associated with new symptoms like weakness, numbness or changes in vision, further workup may be needed. You should discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider.",
    "757": "Hello,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your discomfort. From your description, it sounds like bronchial asthma, which may have resulted due to the tuberculosis treatment or could be a separate ailment. The shortness of breath during a nose block could be developed due to having to respirate through your mouth, which causes your airways to dry out and produce mucus leading to shortness of breath. \n\nHowever, since your lungs are clear, and the ENT specialist detected a nasal allergy, it is possible that your blocked nose and shortness of breath could be symptoms of allergic rhinitis. In this condition the lining of your nose swells due to allergens, resulting in a blocked nose and hence difficulty in breathing.\n\nIn any case, you should consult a pulmonologist for optimal management of the condition. Pulmonary function tests (spirometry) can help in diagnosing issues such as asthma or COPD. This test helps measure how much and how fast you can move air in and out of your lungs. Based on these tests, treatment can be initiated.\n\nAre you on any medication for your nasal allergy? Treatment for allergic rhinitis often includes antihistamines (to reduce sneezing, sniffling, and itching) and decongestants (to clear mucus and congestion from your nose). Nasal corticosteroids are also very effective at reducing inflammation.\n\nRemember, it's also important to get regular follow-ups with your doctor after having had",
    "758": "Hi, I'm sorry to hear about your aunt's condition. In general, the risk of not waking up after surgery depends on various factors such as the patient's overall health, the type of cancer, the extent of its spread, the type of surgery and the expertise of the surgical team. While surgery does carry risks, it is not correct to say that there is a very large chance of a cancer patient not waking up after the operation. \n\nIn fact, surgery can often play an integral part in controlling the growth of the cancer and alleviating symptoms caused by tumours such as pain or functional impairment. The risks involved and expected outcomes should be part of a thorough discussion with the doctor or surgical team before any procedure.\n\nAnesthesia is generally safe and most patients wake up without any complications. But any concern and fear need to be shared with your healthcare team, who are best suited to answer them for you based on your aunt's specific condition and health status.\n\nIt's important to have trust in your healthcare team during such difficult time. If you or your family have any concerns, do discuss them with the doctor involved in your aunt's care. They can provide detailed information that is specific to her current status.",
    "759": "Hello, I understand your concern. It is quite normal for breastfed babies to pass green stool. The color of the stool depends on the diet of the mother. \n\nIn addition to this, the consistency of stools in infants can vary greatly ranging from watery to very hard, especially when babies are only on breast milk. Mucus can occasionally be present in stools and is not always a cause for concern.\n\nThe weight loss, however, is concerning. I would recommend continuing to monitor your baby's weight closely. If he continues to lose weight, I would recommend an immediate follow-up with your baby's pediatrician to discuss the situation.\n\nWith regards to starting semisolid foods, the general recommendation is to start at around 6 months of age. It's better to start with rice cereal mixed with breast milk or formula, then gradually introduce other foods like pureed fruits and vegetables. Ragi porridge can also be introduced a bit later. \n\nRemember, every baby is unique and can react differently to food items. It's essential to introduce new foods slowly, one at a time, over a period of several days to watch for any allergic reactions. Always discuss with your pediatrician before introducing any new food item in your baby's diet.\n\nPlease contact your doctor if you observe any other symptoms or if the condition persists.",
    "760": "Hello, the Widal test results suggest a possibility of Typhoid fever, a bacterial infection from drinking contaminated water or food. Antibiotics are often prescribed to fight the disease. Beside antibiotics, your son must also stay hydrated and maintain good nutrition. Ensure your child has plenty of fluids, like water, oral rehydration solutions, fresh fruit juices, soups, and rice water. For his diet, opt for easily digestible foods like porridge, rice, soft fruits like bananas, yoghurt, etc. High protein diet in form of eggs and lentils will help in recovery. Once the fever subsides, you can gradually introduce normal diet. \nHowever, it's very important that you follow the advice and prescription provided by your primary healthcare provider, as they can monitor the progress and adjust medication dosage if necessary.

    "762": "I'm sorry to hear about your father's condition. Stone formation in common bile duct (CBD) is a common aftermath of cholecytectomy (gallbladder removal). ERCP with a stent helps to keeps the bile duct open and allow the stones to be pushed into the small intestine from where they can pass out with stools.\n\nBalloon sphincterotomy is an endoscopic procedure used to cut the muscle between the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct. This promotes better flow of bile and pancreatic juice to the small intestine, avoiding blockage and reducing the risk of stone formation once again in CBD. It has generally a good prognosis, but like any other procedure, has got its own set of potential complications like pancreatitis, cholangitis etc. \n\nAs for hospitals in Tirupati, India that provide this procedure, Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences is a well known super-specialty hospital where these advanced gastroenterological procedures are done.

    "763": "Hello. It's understandable that you are worried about your grandson's health, especially as the lumps in his groin haven't disappeared after the course of antibiotics. While I agree with your sentiment, it's important to understand that certain conditions can cause temporary lymph node enlargement (like lymphadenopathy) which can resolve with time. These lumps could possibly be lymph nodes that had enlarged due to an earlier infection and may decrease in size over time. However, it's also important not to overlook anything serious. If blood tests are normal, the doctor might conduct imaging tests like an ultrasound or a CT scan to get more clarity on the nature of the lumps. Biopsy is another option if the lumps persist. So, it would appear the doctor is taking a step-by-step approach to cater to the care needed while ruling out possibilities. Yet, if you feel worried, there is no harm in seeking a second opinion.",
    "764": "I understand that you're going through a lot of discomfort due to your gallstone pain. Regarding your question, consuming pistachios might not be the best for this situation. They are high in fat, and the gallbladder releases bile to help digest fats. This could lead to aggravation of your gallstone symptoms. You should focus on a diet that is low in fat and high in fibre. \n\nWhile you wait for your scan, continue to manage the pain. However, if the pain becomes severe, or you experience symptoms such as fever, persistent vomiting, or skin/eyes turning yellow, seek immediate medical attention. These could be signs of complications from gallstones.\n\nRemember, while you might be able to manage the pain right now, continuing on painkillers without getting treatment for the root cause isn't a long-term solution. I strongly recommend you follow up with your doctor regarding the next steps for treatment following your scan.",
    "765": "I'm sorry to hear about your wife's health issues. Those bruises could be due to numerous reasons, not just kidney failure. It could be a side effect of the medications she's taking, a symptom of her overall poor health, or even something unrelated. Since she's currently undergoing many treatments and therapies, it's hard to say definitively. Increased bruising can also be a sign of platelet issues, which can occur in kidney disease. Also, as kidney function declines, there may be anemia or low red blood cell count which can result in bruising as well. However, it's always a good idea to let her healthcare team know about such changes, as they could be indicative of something requiring further investigation. In no way should this be inferred as a horrific holdup of the transplant but rather another aspect of her health that needs attention and management.",
    "766": "The dizziness in the mornings might be a result of the beta blockers your mother is taking for Atrial Fibrillation. One of the common side effects of beta blockers are lightheadedness or dizziness. Additionally, if her blood pressure goes too low under the influence of these medications, it can lead to the symptoms you have described. \n\nHer doctor may need to adjust the dosage or switch her to a different medication if these dizzy spells continue, especially considering she has already fallen once. \n\nFalls in older adults can have serious consequences so it's very important that she reports these symptoms to her doctor straight away. In the meantime, try to ensure her environment is as fall-proof as possible -remove tripping hazards, ensure good lighting, consider using aids like a walker. This can help prevent accidents while her treatment is being adjusted. \n\nAlso, she needs to stand up slowly from lying or sitting position as it can help reduce dizziness. \n\nThis advice is based on information provided and might not be fully accurate without full patient evaluation.",
    "767": "I'm sorry to hear your son is not well. Given the duration and severity of his symptoms, it's important to consider certain conditions like food allergies or intolerance, gastrointestinal infections, or even metabolic disorders. It's generally unusual for a gastrointestinal virus to cause symptoms for such a long duration without any fever. Losing 10 lbs in 3 weeks is significant, especially for a child. \n\nSince his symptoms persist, I recommend taking him to a pediatric gastroenterologist. They may do further investigations such as stool tests, blood tests, and possibly an endoscopy if needed. \n\nIn the meantime, continue to encourage him to drink fluids to avoid dehydration. You can give him electrolyte solutions like Pedialyte. Also, introduce light, easily digestible foods like rice, bananas, and toast in small amounts when he can tolerate it. \n\nThis isn't meant to alarm you, but more to guide you to get the right help for your son. I perfectly understand you're worried, and quick, correct diagnosis and treatment is really crucial here. Keep faith and stay strong, it's definitely hard to see our little ones not doing well.",
    "768": "Hello! I'm ChatDoctor. I'm sorry to hear about your discomfort. The itching you're experiencing could be due to the healing process of the ruptured Bartholin's abscess, similar to how a healing wound itches. It could also be caused by a mild local infection, irritation from drainage or the use of antibiotics if any were prescribed. You can use a mild over-the-counter topical cream like hydrocortisone to help with the itching. Also, maintaining proper hygiene in the area can prevent further irritation or infection. You should see improvements in the next 7-10 days. However, if the itching continues, worsens or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as pain, swelling or discharge, you should consult with a doctor. They may need to assess whether there is a superadded fungal infection or another issue to address. Please remember this is advice based on the limited information you've provided, and the best course of action is to seek medical attention.",
    "769": "Hello, I understand your concern and I'm sorry to hear your wife is experiencing these difficulties. It's a good thing an appointment with Cardiology has been set because this could potentially be related to a heart issue, even if her EKG was normal. It's also good that a CT scan was done, which could have ruled out lung problems. However, if her oxygen levels were not checked, this could be another aspect to consider; sometimes, breathing difficulties can be due to low oxygen levels in the body.\n\nThis might also be related to something called orthopnea, which causes difficulty breathing while standing up or sitting, improving when lying down. This might be seen in conditions such as heart failure, which is why it's important she sees a Cardiologist.\n\nBefore her appointment, if her symptoms worsen, she has chest pain or faints, she should return to the ER immediately. Please watch for these signs and symptoms as they are emergencies. \n\nMeanwhile, try to keep her as comfortable as possible while lying down. She should try to avoid excess physical exertion, and take slow, deep breaths to manage her symptoms. \n\nAlso, anxiety or panic disorders could manifest with breathing difficulty - if she has a history of anxiety, bringing this up with her healthcare provider might help rule out non-physical causes. \n\nPlease remember that these are just possible reasons and she needs to be evaluated by her cardiologist to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.

    "770": "Hello, your symptoms of pins and needles in your arms and legs, muscle weakness in your left arm, blurred vision, dizziness, and balance issues could be related to your rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a systemic disease that can affect other parts of the body, including the nerves and eyes, and can cause symptoms like the ones you described. High levels of ESR indicate inflammation in your body, which is a hallmark feature of RA. However, these symptoms can also be due to other conditions such as a vitamin B12 deficiency, multiple sclerosis (MS), or another neurological disorder. Therefore, you should definitely discuss these symptoms with your doctor or a neurologist. They will likely conduct a neurological exam and may order additional tests such as an MRI or blood tests to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Please do not delay seeking medical attention; these symptoms require a thorough evaluation.",
    "771": "Hello, I understand your concern about wanting to reduce belly fat. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. A nutritious, low-calorie diet: Avoid fried foods, sugars, and processed foods. Instead, eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.\n\n2. Regular Exercise: Continue with yoga and also incorporate both cardio and strengthening exercises. High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) can be particularly effective in burning body fat.\n\n3. Adequate sleep: Make sure you're getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night.\n\n4. Hydrate: Drink plenty of fluids, particularly water.\n\n5. Stress Reduction: High stress can lead to weight gain or difficulty losing weight. Find healthy ways to manage stress such as meditation or other relaxation techniques.\n\nRemember, there's no magic solution to losing belly fat. It takes time, commitment, and consistency. And always consult with your doctor before starting a new diet or exercise regimen, especially if you have health conditions like thyroid and polycystic ovary syndrome.",

There are potential side effects as with any medication. Some of the possible side effects include changes in menstrual bleeding, weight gain, headaches, or mood changes. These effects are usually minimal and not everyone experiences them. It's also important to remember that these potential side effects need to be weighed against the benefits of preventing an unintended pregnancy. \n\nRemember to take the pill at the same time each day for it to be most effective. If you miss pills or take them at different times each day, you are more at risk of becoming pregnant. \n\nIf you have any other concerns or if you experience any changes in your health, don't hesitate to consult your doctor for further advice.  \n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
    "774": "I'm sorry to hear your son is going through this. Impetigo, particularly caused by Staph aureus, can sometimes be difficult to treat. He was previously on Septra, which is an antibiotic that's often effective for this type of bacteria, but unfortunately had an allergic reaction. The Mupirocin is also a good choice, and cortisone helps with inflammation, but it seems from your report that these treatments are not sufficiently managing the infection. \n\nAt this stage, it might be beneficial to consider or discuss other types of oral antibiotics with the dermatologist, since the infection seems extensive. Additionally, ensure that all members of the household are maintaining excellent hygiene, particularly hand hygiene, to avoid further spread of the bacteria. It is also key that any items the baby has been in contact with including personal items, towels, bedding, and clothing are frequently cleaned and not shared among family members, because staph bacteria can live on objects. \n\nYou should definitely continue to follow up with the doctor or dermatologist. If the condition continues to worsen or does not improve, it may be helpful to seek a second opinion. That might offer a fresh perspective or different approaches that could assist in the management of this difficult case.",
    "775": "Hi, I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing such discomfort. In cases of lumbar disc herniation at L4 and L5, which seems to be causing nerve irritation, physiotherapy can be of significant help in relieving pain. Also, medications such as Pregabalin or Gabapentin can help in reducing the burning and numbness you're experiencing. You may need a stronger prescription pain medication to manage the pain. \n\nSteroid injections or nerve block injections can also provide relief for some patients. If all these measures fail, surgical intervention might need to be considered. Surgery is typically the last resort if all conservative measures fail and if the pain is making it hard for you to perform your daily activities.\n\nIt is essential that you discuss these options with your doctor or a spine specialist to know what could be the most beneficial for your circumstances.

Feeling a lump in the vagina can be scary, especially given your mom's history, but it's crucial to remember that not all lumps are cancerous. You might be feeling a cyst, fibroid, or a host of other noncancerous growths. The only way to know for sure is to have a gynecological examination. The changing period pattern, pain, lethargy and feeling sick may all be interrelated, possibly hinting towards conditions like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or Endometriosis. These symptoms can also be part of \"normal\" hormonal changes, particularly in adolescents. Given your history and symptoms, it is important that you see a doctor for an examination and possibly some tests. They will be able to provide advice on vaccinations against HPV which may help reduce your risk for certain types of cancer. It's understandable to feel scared, but you are not alone.

    "778": "Hi, Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition characterized by abnormal patches of skin. Therapy is primarily focused on controlling the symptoms and preventing secondary infections. While it's true that not scratching the psoriasis plaques can help them recover faster and lessen irritation, it's not usually enough to make them \"vanish\" completely.\n\nPsoriasis is characterized by accelerated skin cell growth. So it's not about the sores healing but rather about managing the abnormal growth of the skin cells. That being said, some people with milder psoriasis find that their symptoms may improve with time without medication.\n\nIn terms of avoiding steroid-based treatments, there are many options. Light therapy and topical treatments (vitamin D analogues, retinoids, calcineurin inhibitors) can be options. Systemic medications like methotrexate, oral retinoids, and even biologic drugs are usually reserved for moderate to severe cases. But you should always talk to your doctor or a dermatologist about your treatment options.",
    "779": "Hello,\n\nIt's quite concerning that your husband is still experiencing symptoms despite being on antibiotics for 4 days. Usually, urinary tract infections improve with antibiotics within 2-3 days. \n\nCiprofloxacin is a commonly used antibiotic for UTI but it doesn't work on all types of bacteria. It might be that the bacteria causing the UTI are resistant to Ciprofloxacin. Usually, I recommend a urine culture and sensitivity test before starting antibiotics which helps in identifying the bacteria causing infection and their sensitivity to different antibiotics. This helps in prescribing the most effective antibiotic.\n\nI would advise your husband not to take any more Ciprofloxacin at this time. Please consult with your healthcare provider as soon as possible. They will probably recommend a urine culture and sensitivity test if not done previously and then start him on a different antibiotic based on the results. \n\nMeanwhile, make sure your husband drinks a lot of water and avoids any food or drink that can irritate the bladder, like caffeine and alcohol. Over-the-counter phenazopyridine can help with the burning sensation but it's not a replacement for antibiotics.

    "780": "I'm sorry to hear about your husband's diagnosis. Treatment of pleomorphic sarcoma usually involves surgery to remove the tumor, sometimes followed by radiation therapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. The oncologist has chosen this treatment plan based on your husband's case specifics.\n\nIn terms of the radiation treatments, they should be targeted to cover the tumor and a margin of normal tissue around it for best outcomes. It's hard to predict what impact missing a short portion of the treatments on the lower arm will have. It may potentially increase the risk of local recurrence but this needs to be studied on a person-to-person basis.\n\nAs for the arm being \"contaminated\", this term generally refers to the fact that the cancer has spread to another part of the arm - not to be confused with an infection. But if the tumor was wholly removed during the first surgery, and the arm continues to receive radiation therapies, his prognosis can be good.\n\nWhile I understand your concern for his arm use, please also keep in mind that the goal of these treatments is to ensure all cancerous cells are eliminated. It might be beneficial to discuss your concerns about your husband's functionality with his treatment team. They might be able to recommend rehabilitation services post-treatment to help maintain as much function as possible.\n\nYou are doing the right thing by being informed and asking questions about your husband's treatment.

The slowing of the left testicle as noticed by your GP might indicate some physiological changes, but it doesn't necessarily imply a serious or threatening condition.\n\nWhile I understand your concern about a family history of cancer, the risk of testicular cancer specifically because of a general family history of cancer is not significantly elevated. Also, testicular cancer is relatively rare compared to other types of cancer and it usually presents with a lump or swelling in the testicle rather than pain alone. \n\nHowever, it should be noted that any persistent pain should never be ignored. If the ache in your testicle persists or increases, despite your GP's assurance, you should see a urologist for a more specialized opinion. They may conduct further evaluations such as an ultrasound or a blood test to rule out testicular cancer and other conditions.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be safe and when in doubt, seek a second opinion.",

Most people recover completely within 2 months, however, based on your symptoms it seems like your hepatitis A is prolonging itself as can happen occasionally. Your SGPT and bilirubin are indeed decreasing so it looks like you’re on the recovery path. You should continue following a balanced diet, and avoid fatty foods and alcohol entirely. Once your symptoms are completely gone and your liver function tests are within normal range, you can gradually return to a normal diet, but always remember to take precautions to prevent future infections, such as practicing good hygiene, eating properly cooked food, and avoid drinking untreated water. Bi-weekly monitoring might be necessary until your tests are back to normal. Please consult your doctor and follow the advice given. Wishing you a speedy recovery.",

Difficulty swallowing, also known as dysphagia, can occur due to various reasons, including infections, conditions affecting the nerves and muscles, and certain cancers. If the swallowing problem is due to an infection, treating the infection itself should gradually help relieve the symptoms. \n\nHowever, if this symptom persists even after treating the infection, further investigation would be necessary to rule out other potential serious conditions including esophageal cancer. Many people with esophageal cancer live much longer than the statistics suggest, earlier diagnoses and newer treatments may result in a better outlook. It's very important to carefully monitor your father's symptoms and maintain regular communication with his doctor. If symptomatic relief from swallowing difficulties is not achieved with initial treatment, do seek further medical evaluation as soon as possible.\n  \nChanges in swallowing ability may be temporary due to a treatable infection or they could suggest a more serious condition, so do continue to keep in touch with his healthcare team, and raise any new or worsening symptoms with them promptly.

The reported window for successful extraction is typically within 24 to 48 hours postmortem; however, in certain cases, viable sperm have been retrieved up to 72 hours or more after death, particularly if the body is kept cool.

Other possibilities could be due to poor circulation in the legs, nerve impingement, or a condition named claudication, which can also cause calf cramping especially during walking. Regular stretching and strengthening exercises of the calf muscles can help to relieve symptoms along with adequate hydration. However, if the pain continues to be severe and is not relieved by rest and simple pain relief measures, it would be advisable for him to get a further medical evaluation, possibly including an ultrasound scan, to rule out more serious conditions like a blood clot or peripheral vascular disease, especially if there is any associated swelling, warmth or color change in the legs. I would recommend him to see his orthopedic specialist or primary care physician for an evaluation of his symptoms.",
    "800": "Hello Nitin, \n\nI understand your concern. A low sperm count paired with poor motility does pose a challenge in terms of natural conception, as it reduces the chances of the sperm successfully reaching and fertilizing the egg. \n\nYour doctor has prescribed Maxoza, which is a combination of multivitamin, multiminerals, and antioxidants to improve the sperm health. However, drastic improvements may not be seen immediately and take up to 2-3 months, as the process of sperm production is approximately 74 days.\n\nIn terms of conceiving, other than natural conception, options like intrauterine insemination (IUI), in-vitro fertilization (IVF), or Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) could be considered. You would need to speak with a fertility specialist to discuss these potential options and determine the best route for you and your partner.\n\nLifestyle and diet modifications can also play a role in improving your fertility. This includes maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol and tobacco consumption, avoiding high temperatures (like saunas/hot tubs), and eating a diet rich in key vitamins and minerals.\n\nPlease follow up with your doctor for more personalized advice, and don't lose hope. Many couples with similar challenges have successfully conceived with the right treatment and professional guidance.",
    "801": "Hello, I understand your concerns. The bleeding you experienced on August 15 was most likely a result of taking the emergency contraceptive pill. These pills contain high levels of hormones that can affect your normal cycle and cause unexpected or unusual bleeding, also known as withdrawal bleeding.\n\nAs to when you should expect your next period, it's difficult to say with certainty as emergency contraceptives can disrupt your normal cycle. It could be on your regular due date, or it could be earlier or later.\n\nRegarding the risk of pregnancy, again, it's difficult to say with certainty. Emergency contraceptives are generally quite effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, but they are not 100% fail-proof. If the condom broke on August 11 and you didn't take another pill, there is a risk, albeit very small, of pregnancy.\n\nConsidering your circumstances and given that you've taken an emergency contraceptive again on August 18, it would be advisable to take a pregnancy test if your period doesn't arrive within a week after your expected date.\n\nAnd yes, researching other methods of effective contraception (like dual protection with condoms and regular birth control pills, or an IUD etc) would be a healthy choice given your experience with condom breakages and emergency contraceptives. You can have a discussion with a healthcare provider about which methods might suit you best.\n\nRemember, emergency contraceptives are for emergencies and not really designed for regular use. Regular use can lead to hormonal imbalances and a",
    "802": "Hello, I understand your concern for your aunt. After a cardiac event such as a heart attack and subsequent surgery, the recovery period needed before it's considered safe to fly can vary greatly. It usually depends on the patient's overall cardiac health, the specific nature of the procedure, and the patient's personal recovery progress. \n\nFrom a general perspective, after a coronary angioplasty (which is a type of keyhole surgery to unblock arteries), guidelines typically suggest waiting at least one week before taking a short flight and between 2-3 weeks for longer flights. \n\nHowever, this is a general guideline and individual medical circumstances can change that. It's essential that she consults with her primary care physician or cardiologist to get accurate advice for her specific case. They will have detailed knowledge about her health status and recovery, and can provide advice on when it would be safe for her to fly. \n\nMake sure your aunt contact her carrier and insurance company as well, as some airlines and insurance companies may have restrictions on passengers who've recently undergone cardiac procedures. \n\nAs always, whenever she does fly, it's a good idea to ensure easy access to medical care at her destination, have a copy of all her prescriptions, and enough supply of her current medications. \n\nHope this helps.",
    "803": "Hello, the rash after your hip surgery may or may not be related to the procedure. Rash could be due to multiple causes including medications, infections, systemic diseases etc. If it's only limited to face, it could also be due to contact dermatitis (allergy to something that came in contact with your face). Allergic reactions can occur to medications used during or after surgery, or to the material used in bandages or dressings. \n\nAs you have stopped taking the pain medications over a week ago and the rash is still present and spreading, this might be less likely although still possible. It is important to consult a dermatologist for evaluation and management. They might need to do some tests (such as patch testing, skin prick testing) to identify the cause. \n\nIn the meantime, keeping the skin moisturized may help. Avoid scratching the area and avoid potential allergens or irritants including harsh soaps, fragrances, dyes, and certain fabrics until the cause is determined. Please consult a healthcare provider for further management.",
    "804": "Hello, what you're describing sounds like you could be suffering from a condition referred to as \"cold-induced tooth pain\" or \"dental hypersensitivity.\" This can occur when your teeth enamel wears down or your gums recede, thereby exposing the dentin layer of the teeth. Dentin is connected to the nerve that triggers pain in teeth. Therefore, when exposed to colder temperatures, it may cause sudden, sharp flashes of pain, that could last for a longer time.\n\nSometimes, it might also be due to undiagnosed decay or cracks in your teeth that become sensitive to temperature changes. Your sinuses are located very close to your jaw, so the pressure changes associated with the cold weather can cause aches and pains in your sinus area, which can be felt as tooth pain as well.\n\nIf this continues to be a problem, I would highly suggest booking an appointment with your dentist. They can examine for the signs of wear and tear, or decay, and could help formulate a plan to reduce your sensitivity.\n\nIn the meantime, try using a toothpaste specially formulated for sensitive teeth, avoid acidic foods and drinks, and try to breathe through your nose when you're out in the cold to help warm the air you're breathing in. Please note that all these are speculative and a more definitive diagnosis can be made by a dentist after proper clinical examination.",

People with this condition feel an overwhelming urge to pull out their hair. It is commonly associated with anxiety and stress. Management involves cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help identify triggers and develop coping mechanisms. Also, medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be helpful in some cases. It's important to seek help from a mental health professional, as in some severe cases trichotillomania can lead to skin damage or other health problems. Sometimes meeting with a support group can be helpful for management of symptoms. You should discuss with a psychiatrist for a more effective treatment plan.",

I hope this helps to alleviate your concerns. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have further questions or concerns.",
    "807": "Hello. It sounds like you're having a tough recovery from a significant injury, I'm sorry to hear that. A comminuted depressed tibial plateau fracture is a serious injury, and it can take a considerable amount of time to heal completely and for function to return to the joint. Femoral condylitis, inflammation of the condyles of the femur, could be secondary to your injury. This can cause pain and swelling, and could potentially contribute to your inability to fully straighten your leg. It's hard for me to give you an exact timeline for your recovery as it can depend on a lot of factors - the exact nature of your injury, your overall health, your physiotherapy regimen, etc. However, don't lose hope. It's important to stick with your physiotherapy and follow your doctor's instructions to get the best outcome you can. Don't hesitate to discuss your concerns with your doctor or physiotherapist, as they'll be best positioned to give you more specific advice.\n",

You should be able to find my email address on the platform or through the front desk. Feel free to send over your results. In the meantime, try to capture exactly what you're feeling. Tracking your symptoms, when they occur, what you're doing when they occur, etc. can be very helpful in diagnosing your condition. It's also worth mentioning that at your age, some heart rhythm disturbances are not uncommon and can be caused by stress or anxiety. However, I agree that it's smart to follow up on this issue to ensure nothing more serious is happening. I'll await your email.\n",

It might be a hematoma, which is a collection of blood that's escaped from the blood vessels into the tissue due to trauma or injury - in your case, perhaps strain from lifting and carrying the wood. However, since you're on blood thinners and have a complex medical history, it's important to get this evaluated by a doctor. The blood thinners could prolong bleeding and hence the hematoma might be larger than typical. They could also rule out other potential causes like a deep venous thrombosis. Please reach out to your healthcare provider for medical attention.",
    "810": "Hello, it's important to get these symptoms evaluated promptly. The chest muscle twitching you're experiencing could be benign, particularly if it isn't accompanied by other symptoms, but the changes in heart rate should be evaluated, especially given your age and history of hypertension.\n\nTypically, your primary care doctor can make a connection with a cardiologist if they deem it necessary. When you talk to your doctor, be sure to mention both the twitching sensation and the changes in your heart rate, as that will help inform their thoughts on potential diagnoses. They may recommend a Holter monitor test (a device you wear for a day or more that records all your heartbeats) to capture the heart rate changes you've been experiencing. The test will show if you're having heart rhythm problems and how your heart responds to these situations.\n\nHowever, if you find the symptoms worsening or if you start experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or fainting, you should seek immediate medical attention as it may indicate a serious condition. Avoid strenuous activity or anything that increases your symptoms until your doctor has evaluated you.",
    "811": "Hello, the chance of getting pregnant in the way you've described is extremely low. Pregnancy generally occurs as a result of sexual intercourse where semen has been deposited in or near the vagina. It requires that a sperm manages to fertilize an egg in the woman's fallopian tube. While it's true that semen can contain thousands of sperm, the conditions in which they could possibly travel from your hand to your vagina in the scenario you've described are highly unlikely. Given that, you should not be overly concerned about pregnancy from this specific event. However, if you're regularly sexually active and don't want to get pregnant, I would recommend considering a reliable method of contraception.",
    "812": "Hello, I understand your concerns. You're presenting with elevated liver enzymes (ALT - Alanine transaminase) and bilirubin levels, along with ultrasonographic evidence of fatty liver changes. Several conditions can cause these results, including fatty liver disease, alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, certain medications, and even some forms of heart disease. \n\nThe fatty liver changes indicate that there's an excess of fat being stored in the liver cells, which can be due to multiple causes such as diet, lack of physical exercise, obesity, alcohol use, diabetes, or high cholesterol. \n\nTo control these levels and start reversing the fatty changes, here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. Diet and Exercise: Adopt a healthy, balanced diet and engage in regular exercise, aiming for at least 150 minutes per week. This will help in losing weight and reducing the burden on your liver.\n\n2. Limit Alcohol: If you do consume alcohol, it's important to limit your intake, as alcohol can worsen liver damage.\n\n3. Control any underlying conditions: If you have any conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity, ensure that they're well-managed.\n\n4. Regular monitoring: Regular follow-ups with your doctor and routine liver function tests are necessary to monitor improvement and possibly modify the treatment plan accordingly. \n\nIf these measures don't work or if your condition worsens, then you may need to consult with a hepatologist for further evaluation and management.

Conditions such as a dental abscess, tonsillitis or ear infections can cause the lymph nodes in these areas to swell. It can also be a sign of a viral infection like mononucleosis or the mumps, especially if you have other symptoms like fatigue, fever, or sore throat. \nHowever, given you're experiencing ear pain, it would be a good idea to get it checked out by a doctor to rule out other underlying conditions or infections.

Please go to a hospital or doctor as soon as possible to get these symptoms checked out. Keep following your gluten-free diet, and make sure you're also eating a balanced diet with enough nutrients.

Keeping your living environment as clean as possible can help, such as frequent dusting and vacuuming, using air purifiers, and avoiding carpet if possible. You may also find relief by using over-the-counter antihistamines or decongestants. \n\nIn the short-term, for your night-time wheezing, try propping yourself up when you sleep, as this sometimes can help make breathing easier. \n\nHowever, given the severity of the issue and the disruption it's causing to your daily life, you should see an Allergist-Immunologist as soon as possible. Meanwhile, you can also consult your local practitioner for a Bronchodilator Inhaler which can provide some relief in cases of severe breathing difficulty.\n\nPlease remember that while medication can help in managing the symptoms, the only permanent solution relies in systematic desensitization through allergen-specific immunotherapy, which you should discuss with your Allergist-Immunologist. \n\nAs always, if you are having severe breathing difficulty or an asthma attack, please seek emergency medical attention.",

    "818": "Given your father's age and the duration of his wheezing problem, he likely has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic asthma. Using Asthalin, which is a short-acting bronchodilator, provides quick relief from symptoms but does not control the underlying inflammation.\n\nIn such chronic cases, a combination of long-acting bronchodilator and an inhaled corticosteroid is often more beneficial and provides better control of symptoms. Medications like Salmeterol/Fluticasone (Seretide or Advair) or Tiotropium (Spiriva) are commonly prescribed. I would suggest you discuss this with your father's doctor.\n\nPlease note that these medications require a prescription from a healthcare provider. It's also recommended that he quit smoking (if he is a smoker) and get vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcus to prevent exacerbations. \n\nYour father should also have regular follow-ups with his doctor and possibly a lung function test to monitor his condition.\n\nRemember, online advice is not a substitute for a consultation with a healthcare professional.

    "819": "Hello, \nThank you for reaching out. Having an AMH level of 0.3 indicates that your ovary reserve is quite low, which may limit the potential for conception. This occurs naturally as a women ages and is expected by the age of 40. However, you mentioned that in your recent scan, your right ovary released an egg, suggesting that you are still ovulating. Although your chances of conceiving naturally are reduced, it isn't impossible. \n\nTo increase your chances, I would recommend maintaining a healthy weight, a balanced diet, regular exercise, avoiding stress, and trying to have regular intercourse around your ovulation days. \n\nYour doctor has also prescribed you Ovigyn and Fertisure, which will help to increase your fertility. If you haven't done so already, you might want to consider asking your doctor about trying assisted reproductive technology (ART) like Intrauterine insemination (IUI) more than once or in vitro fertilization (IVF). Unfortunately, with low ovarian reserves, the success rate with these methods could be lower. \n\nIt's important to discuss your concerns with your fertility specialist, maybe even seek a second opinion if you feel it's necessary. Remember, every person's body responds differently and what works for one might not work for the other. It's about finding what best suits your own situation. Best of luck and take care.",

The lumps you describe could be due to a few things, such as an oral infection, mucocele (blocked salivary glands), canker sores or less likely a cyst or mol inflammation from trauma or an irritation.\n\nThe fact that you have pain in both the roof of your mouth and partly in your jaw might be an indication of an ongoing infection in your body, given you mentioned you currently have a flu-like illness, as viral or bacterial infections can sometimes cause the lymph nodes in the areas such as neck and jaw to inflame and become tender.\n\nHowever, without a physical examination, it's difficult to say definitively what the issue could be. I would recommend you see a dentist or a doctor as soon as possible to get a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, avoid hot and spicy foods and maintain good oral hygiene by regular brushing and use of mouthwash.\n\nAnd please don't neglect your flu-like symptoms either.

Unfortunately, doctors aren't sure what causes kidney cancer. It's not clear what the risk factors are, although smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, and a family history of the disease may increase the chances. Regarding the appearance of symptoms, it is indeed often the case that kidney cancer doesn't cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. In the later stages, kidney cancer signs and symptoms may include blood in your urine, back pain just below the ribs, weight loss, fatigue, intermittent fever, cough etc. But all these symptoms can be due to many other reasons too. It's great that you are getting treated, and I encourage you to ask your oncologist all the questions you may have, including about the efficacy of Sutent in your case. Your doctor is your best source of information in these scenarios. I wish you the best of luck with your upcoming scan.",

However, if you're experiencing persistent and increasing difficulty in breathing despite your asthma treatment, it's definitely a concern that needs to be investigated further. While your symptoms might still be due to poorly controlled asthma, certain heart conditions could also lead to similar symptoms. Therefore, it is advisable to see a doctor as soon as possible. You need to get an ECG (Electrocardiogram) and an echocardiogram done to screen for any possible heart diseases and you should continue seeing your pulmonologist for optimal asthma control. In the meantime, try not to stress too much, as anxiety can also exacerbate such problems.",
    "824": "Hello and thank you for your query,\nIn general, atrial septal defects (ASDs) of the size you mentioned (16x17mm) rarely close on their own. In fact, this is considered to be a large ASD, and it can cause problems over time such as pulmonary hypertension (high pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs) and eventually heart failure. This process can take many years, but it is something that could potentially be prevented with ASD closure.\n\nASD device closure is a minimally invasive procedure that is done through cardiac catheterization, rather than open-heart surgery. The risks associated with ASD closure are relatively low, particularly when performed by an experienced operator in a high-volume center. The device itself is made from materials that are well-tolerated by the human body (usually a combination of metal and fabric). Once the device is in place, the lining of the heart grows over the device, and it becomes a permanent part of the heart.\n\nThis is a decision that should be made in consultation with your daughter's pediatric cardiologist, who can explain the risks and benefits of the procedure in more detail.

It's difficult for me to pinpoint an underlying condition without further examination and information, but here are my suggested steps:\n\n1) Detailed Examination: Continue meeting with your orthopedic specialist to evaluate your hip, shoulder, and back pain. It might be a good idea to visit a neurologist as well, especially since you've been experiencing lingering pain for several years.\n\n2) Physical Therapy: Regular exercises & therapeutic activities can help alleviate some of the pain you're experiencing. It can also help regain muscle strength and flexibility.\n\n3) Imaging Tests: If not done already, MRI can be used to better assess the situation of your shoulder and hip to get a clearer look at your muscles, joints, and nerves. This might give a better idea whether you qualify for surgical interventions.\n\n4) Pain Management: Regular use of over-the-counter pain medications (like NSAIDs), prescribed by your doctor along with other possible pain medications or muscle relaxants, can help.\n\nLastly, if you feel your current doctor is not addressing your concerns, seek a second opinion. This might provide new perspectives and alternative treatment options.

Typically, the jaw stiffness and discomfort should begin to ease within a few days to a week, but in more severe cases, it may take a bit longer.\n  \nI would recommend continuing with the prescribed medication. Over-the-counter pain relievers may also be helpful. Try using warm compresses on the jaw area several times a day, this can help to relax the muscles. Stick to a soft or liquid diet until you can open your mouth properly - things like soups, smoothies and soft fruits are ideal.\n  \nIt's essential to keep the mouth clean during this time, so continue to brush and floss as best as you can.

    "834": "I'm sorry to hear about your husband's condition. His elevated BNP, presence of fluid requiring paracentesis, and organ enlargement suggest that his congestive heart failure (CHF) may not be well-controlled. It's extremely difficult to provide a precise prognosis without thorough knowledge of his overall clinical condition, response to medications, comorbid conditions, and physical examination findings. I recommend continuing close follow-up with his cardiologist. Prognoses in end-stage CHF can vary greatly depending on these variables. His physicians, who have the full clinical picture, are better able to provide a more accurate prognosis. Treatment of CHF typically includes medications that can help the heart pump more efficiently, reduce fluid accumulation, and address the underlying cause of the heart failure, if known. Other interventions, like lifestyle changes, could also improve his condition. It's important that you communicate your concerns with his healthcare team —they can guide you through this challenging time and answer questions specifically related to your husband's care.",
    "835": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out. Your history of prostate cancer, radiation, and anti-androgen therapy suggests that you were appropriately treated. However, the rapidly rising PSA and the presence of enlarged periaortic lymph nodes are concerning. \n\nGiven your age and medical history, it's important to discuss your options with your healthcare provider or oncologist. There are a few treatment routes that can be explored further. \n\nYou could consider more aggressive forms of hormone therapy, like abiraterone or enzalutamide, which have been found effective in castration-resistant prostate cancer. \n\nChemotherapy is another option. Though this may be tough given your age, some well-selected patients can tolerate it well and it can provide significant benefits in certain circumstances.\n\nImmunotherapy with drugs like pembrolizumab could certainly be an option, though these treatments are better studied in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n\nRadiation to the lymph nodes might also be considered, if you're a candidate for further radiation treatment\n\nLastly, a referral to a clinical trial might also be a good option to explore if standard treatments don't offer the results you're hoping for.\n\nIt'll be important to have open discussions with your healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of these options, taking your personal health and quality of life into consideration.\nRemember that while I, as a digital assistant doctor, can provide advice and knowledge, making a medical decision should always involve consultation with a healthcare provider in person.\n",
    "836": "The symptoms you are describing could possibly be due to an allergic reaction or an autoimmune response. Because some of your symptoms are quite severe, I would highly recommend seeking medical attention. Shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, or progression of the swelling may indicate a serious reaction. If possible, you should go to the emergency department. Some of your symptoms could also be related to Sjogren's syndrome, a type of autoimmune disease that commonly causes dryness of the mouth, but it would not explain the sudden onset of your symptoms. It would be important to have a full evaluation to determine the cause. You may need blood tests, imaging of the salivary glands or possibly a biopsy depending on the physical exam findings. Remember, this platform provides medical advice, but it does not replace a physical exam and complete evaluation from a healthcare provider. Please seek immediate medical care.",
    "837": "I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing these symptoms. Pain during urination, coupled with bleeding, suggests a potential infection or other serious condition such as a urinary tract infection, kidney stones, or even trauma to the area. This is something that needs immediate attention. Please seek medical help immediately. While waiting for medical help, try to stay hydrated and avoid any irritants. But again, please seek help immediately as this could be a serious condition.",
    "838": "Hello there. I do understand your concern. Paralysis or loss of stability is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. While it's unlikely that masturbation or the position you were in during masturbation has caused this problem, I cannot completely rule out other underlying issues. It could be a temporary or chronic condition, caused by a variety of factors, such as nerve damage, conditions that affect the nervous system (like multiple sclerosis), or certain types of injuries. \n\nGiven that you've undergone various treatments but only seen temporary improvements, I would strongly recommend seeking an appointment with a neurologist. They will be able to conduct a thorough examination and potentially suggest different diagnostic tests, such as MRIs or nerve conduction tests, to determine the cause of your instability. Until you see a professional, I would suggest refraining from any activity, including masturbation, that you feel could exacerbate the issue.",
    "839": "I'm sorry to hear that you've been having this problem. Your symptoms may be consistent with a form of eczema known as atopic dermatitis, which often presents in the creases of the elbows and knees and can be extremely itchy. It can be triggered by various factors, including allergens, irritants, and stress. However, other conditions such as psoriasis or a different type of eczema could also be possible.\n\nThe corticosteroid cream that your doctor prescribed can help to reduce the inflammation and itchiness, but it's important to also keep the skin moisturized. Over-the-counter emollients or creams that are free of added fragrances and colorings can be helpful for this.\n\nIt could also be beneficial to consult a dermatologist for a more definitive diagnosis. They might perform allergy testing or a skin biopsy to get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, try to avoid scratching as much as possible because this can worsen the inflammation and potentially lead to infection.",
    "840": "Hello, it sounds like you may be experiencing a mild reaction to the Crest Pro Health mouthwash. It is not common, but some people can have sensitivity or mild allergic reactions to certain ingredients in oral health products. For relief, I would recommend rinsing your mouth with warm salt water a few times a day. This can help soothe the soreness and tingling. Also, avoid using the mouthwash for the time being and see if your symptoms improve. If the tingling sensation and soreness continue for more than 24-48 hours, or worsens over time, you should seek medical attention to rule out other possible conditions. Make sure to stay hydrated and maintain a mild and soft diet till the discomfort subsides. This information is just for guidance; it’s vital to consult with your healthcare provider.",
    "841": "Lymph nodes can increase in size due to infections or inflammation and it doesn't always mean you have cancer. The pain you are experiencing may be related to the lymph node itself or the surrounding tissues. It's essential to mention these symptoms to your doctor. If you have a doctor's appointment booked already, make sure you bring this up during your visit. If you haven't, it might be wise to arrange one. Although your biopsy results came back clear which is reassuring, it's always better to keep your doctor updated about any new symptoms or changes in your condition. These symptoms do not necessarily mean that this is a precursor to cancer, other conditions or problems could be causing these conditions. However, this still needs to be evaluated in person by your doctor.",
    "842": "I'm sorry to hear that you are not feeling well. As a doctor, I'd suggest that you seek immediate medical care, since you are describing symptoms like bloody stools and vomiting blood, which could be a sign of a serious condition, perhaps a bleeding ulcer. In some patients, long-standing pancreatitis can lead to the inflammation of the upper intestinal tract, causing gastritis, and eventually resulting in bleeding. Therefore, it's possible that your pancreas issue may be contributing to your gastritis. However, it's also possible that there may be another cause for your symptoms. You may need a gastroscopy to assess the extent and source of bleeding. Medications to control acid secretion in the stomach can also be considered and it is vitally important that you see a healthcare provider as soon as you can, given your symptoms.",
    "843": "I'm sorry you're feeling this way. If the pain around your lower back and hip area is flaring up again post gallbladder surgery and you're constantly feeling nauseous, it's important to have this evaluated by a healthcare professional. There could be several causes for these symptoms including kidney issues, ovarian problems, gastrointestinal disorders, or even surgical complications. I recommend getting in touch with either your surgeon or primary care doctor as soon as possible. They will likely want to run some tests, which could include blood work and imaging studies, to understand the source of the pain and nausea. It's also very important that you stay hydrated, especially if the nausea is making it difficult for you to eat. It may be beneficial to eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day, rather than traditional larger meals. This could help manage your nausea.",
    "844": "Feeling sleepy and tired can be related to several causes. It could be a residual effect of your recent malaria infection, as malaria can really drain your energy levels and it can take time to fully recover from it. However, we should also consider other possible conditions like anemia, hypothyroidism, blood sugar irregularities, chronic fatigue syndrome, and depression. \n\nSince high blood pressure runs in your family, it would be wise to regularly check your blood pressure levels. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can also cause tiredness and fatigue.\n\nHere are few steps to consider:\n\n1. Hydrate well and have a balanced diet.\n2. Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep. \n3. Try regular physical exercise, if it doesn't exhaust you further.\n4. Avoid alcohol, smoking, and caffeine. \n\nIf your fatigue persists or increases, it would be advisable to visit a doctor for further investigation, who might recommend a blood test or specific screening based on your symptoms. Please remember that it's important not to ignore ongoing fatigue as it could be a sign of a more serious medical disorder.\n\n",
    "845": "It sounds like you may have experienced a superficial vein thrombosis (clot in a vein just below the skin's surface). The symptoms can indeed include a painful, red, hard cord along the vein and it may cause local bruising too. While this condition is not as dangerous as a deep vein thrombosis (clot deeper inside the veins), it can sometimes be associated with such clots. I would suggest that you reach out to a healthcare provider who can examine your leg and decide if further testing or treatment are needed, such as blood thinners or supportive care like compression stockings. Please do this as soon as possible.",
    "846": "Good Morning, and thank you for reaching out. Elevated SGPT levels can often be associated with conditions causing liver disease or damage. Reducing these levels quickly can be challenging, but it's beneficial to adjust your diet and increase physical activity. \n\nStaying away from alcohol and any unnecessary medication, especially painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs, can help. A diet low in fats, with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, would promote liver health.\n\nHowever, it's challenging to significantly lower SGPT levels in just a few days. Such a change usually happens over a longer period of time. I would recommend getting a retest, possibly in a different lab, to confirm the results. \n\nYou should also have a conversation with a healthcare provider who might further assess your overall health and potentially prescribe liver-protective drugs if necessary. \n\nPlease remember this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate evaluation and treatment.\n",
    "847": "Hi, persistent sneezing for months could indeed indicate an allergy to something. It could be something in your environment like dust, pollen, or mold. However, your recent symptoms including tiredness, body aches, vomiting, cold/flu-like symptoms, and blood in your mucus, are not typical for an allergic reaction. They are more suggestive of an infection, possibly a respiratory tract infection, which needs to be addressed promptly. I recommend doing a complete blood count, X-ray chest, and maybe even a CT scan if needed. Visiting your healthcare provider to discuss these symptoms would be a good next step. They can conduct a physical exam and possibly order further tests to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. Please don't delay seeking medical attention.",
    "848": "I'm really sorry to hear about your aunt's condition. It seems she may be dealing with oesophageal cancer or a severe stricture in the food pipe. In these situations, the first step should be to try to relieve the blockage if possible. This could involve using a stent (a tube inserted into the oesophagus to keep it open) or a feeding tube to bypass the blocked part of the food pipe. If the blockage can't be relieved, liquid nutritional supplements might be needed to maintain nutrition. Chemotherapy or radiation may help, but it depends on the specifics of her condition. Regarding her weight loss, high calorie and high protein diet might be needed. \n\nOf course, these are only general suggestions - your aunt's doctors in PGI will be able to provide more detailed advice tailored to her situation. They know her case and her restrictions. You can also consider taking a second opinion from a top hospital like AIIMS. \n\nPhysical comfort measures, pain management, and emotional support are also critical in this stage. Please make sure your aunt has all the support she can get. I hope this helps and best wishes to your aunt.",
    "849": "Hello, thank you for your query. Imatinib is a medication used to treat certain types of cancer, including some types of leukemia, which is a type of blood cancer. It's a targeted therapy that works by inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. \n\nThe availability of the drug and its cost would vary from place to place and institution to institution. Some government hospitals and institutions may provide it for free under certain circumstances. However, as for the specific locations you mentioned, you would need to directly contact those hospitals or cancer institutes for the most accurate information regarding the availability and cost of Imatinib. I don't have direct information on these institutions' policies and procedures. \n\nIt's always advisable to consult with the treating oncologist about the cost, potential benefits, and risks associated with the use of drugs like Imatinib.

    "850": "Hello, I understand you're going through a challenging time. To answer your question, re-transplantation after rejection and with positive HCV status is technically possible, however, the success rates can be lower due to the issues related to previous organ rejection and the presence of Hepatitis C virus.\n\nBefore going for re-transplantation, it is definitely recommended to consider treatment for HCV. Untreated HCV can have detrimental effects on your health and on the success of the transplant. It can lead to liver disease and graft infection in the newly transplanted kidney. I would highly recommend collaborating with your nephrologist and a liver disease specialist to treat your HCV infection prior to reconsidering transplantation.\n\nAlso, it is best to conduct a thorough discussion with your doctors including a transplant surgeon about the risks and benefits of re-transplantation and how to optimize your health before transplant for best outcomes.

It's possible that your husband may be experiencing some post-procedure inflammation or nerve irritation from the stent placement, both of which can cause pain, swelling, and discomfort. Given the continued severity of his symptoms, it would be ideal for him to have a follow-up appointment with his vascular specialist. Additional tests might be run to ensure there are no complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Controlling the pain is critical, but we also want to ensure there is no underlying issue that needs to be addressed. Please seek immediate emergency care if symptoms worsen dramatically or if he develops chest pain or has trouble breathing.",
    "852": "Hello there. I'm sorry you're dealing with this discomfort. It sounds like you're suffering from hemorrhoids, which can certainly be painful especially if they become thrombosed or if they start bleeding.\n\nSurgical treatment is just one part of the treatment, but it's typically reserved for more severe or persistent cases. For less severe cases, home remedies are normally advised. These remedies include using over-the-counter creams to help reduce swelling and pain, sitting in a warm bath a few times a day, avoiding sitting for prolonged periods, and preventing constipation by eating a high-fiber diet, drinking plenty of water, and using a stool softener if needed.\n\nIn the case of increased discomfort due to menstruation and heavy bleeding, it's important to maintain good hygiene to prevent any potential infection in that area, especially if you're using a cloth. It would be advisable to clean the area gently with warm water during each change. \n\nPlease seek medical attention as there may be chance of infection or inflammation that may need to be treated appropriately. It's also not clear if you suffer from external or internal hemorrhoids without a physical examination, so seeing a healthcare professional is a necessary step to clarify.",
    "854": "Based on the symptoms you describe, I understand it can be unsettling. There are many potential causes for the symptoms you've mentioned including vascular issues (venous insufficiency), hormonal imbalance, and certain autoimmune conditions. However, from your description, it is not very clear what these \"bruises\" look like, whether they are raised, discolored skin or real bruising. \n\nIf your feet are always cold, you may have poor circulation. This usually also causes the numbness in the toes as well. Peripheral neuropathy, a result of nerve damage, often causes numbness and pain in your hands and feet. Many factors can cause this damage, including diabetes, traumatic injuries, infections and exposure to toxins. And, there are many factors that can cause \"growing pains\", including electrolyte imbalances.\n\nRegarding your blood test results, it’s good that your platelets and organ function are normal. The fluctuating thyroid levels could also be contributing to these symptoms, as the thyroid plays a role in circulation, nervous system function, and skin health. An underactive thyroid can lead to poor circulation in the extremities, and an overactive thyroid can cause overheating and discomfort. \n\nAs such, you should ensure your doctor checks for:\n1.\tVascular ultrasound/Doppler to assess the blood flow in your lower limbs, \n2.\tFurther assessment of your thyroid function with hormone levels (like T3, T4, TSH etc), \n3.\tAuto",
    "855": "Hello, it seems like your baby might be having a gastrointestinal infection or a continuing throat infection that's causing these symptoms. It's also possible that the cough and vomiting is related to the mucus dripping down into the stomach from the throat infection. I would recommend taking your baby to his pediatrician right away to get an examination and possibly a different antibiotic if needed. For the fever, continue to use paracetamol as per dosage instructions. Try to keep your baby well hydrated, and offer small, frequent meals. Diarrhea can be a side effect of antibiotics too so the pediatrician might prescribe a probiotic. But it's important to be sure that the diarrhea is not caused by a new infection. Don't worry, your baby should be alright once he is properly diagnosed and treated.",
    "856": "Hello, thank you for your question. It sounds like you might be dealing with symptomatic cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), which can occur with or without gallstones. The fact that your symptoms responded to antibiotic treatment is a good sign that bacteria was involved in the inflammation, but the return of symptoms after stopping medication suggests that there might be an ongoing issue.\n\nThe exact cause of gallbladder inflammation without gallstones can vary. It could be due to a gallbladder infection, biliary sludge (tiny sand-like particles), gallbladder polyps, tumors, or other causes.\n\nFurther evaluation is required to determine the best treatment approach. It could include a HIDA scan to assess gallbladder function, Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), or Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to visualize the bile ducts.\n\nIf there is recurrent inflammation and pain, despite antibiotics, gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) may indeed be recommended. However, every case is unique and should be evaluated individually, so it is important to continue communication with your healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms, test results and potential treatment options.",
    "857": "Hello. With a persistent cough, it could be related to various causes inclusive of the lungs, such as pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis, or an allergic reaction. It's difficult to diagnose without an appropriate physical examination. However, if the doctor has initiated treatment and if there's no other significant symptoms like fever, rapid breathing, bluish color around lips while coughing, or lethargy etc, you might continue with the medication and see if it's helping him. However, if his symptoms don't improve or worsen, you should immediately seek a second medical opinion. As to your question, it is imaginable that this cough could indeed be related to a transient reactivity of his bronchi (the airways that lead into the lungs) which is common in this age. As his investigations are reportedly normal, it's most likely nothing chronic or serious. But please ensure you keep his physician updated about his progress.",
    "858": "Given the location of the lump and the history of an injury, it is possible that this is an area of localized inflammation or a small hematoma (a solid swelling of clotted blood within the tissues) from the injury. Sometimes, muscle or tendon strains can also cause similar symptoms.\n\nAnother consideration would be a muscular or soft tissue tumor such as a lipoma, though these are typically not painful. \n\nTo ensure a proper diagnosis, you should see a doctor who can examine the lump directly. You may need an X-ray or an ultrasound scan to understand the nature of this lump. In cases where the lump does not dissipate or if it increases in size, a biopsy might be necessary. \n\nTreatment will depend on the diagnosis. If it is inflammation or a hematoma, rest, ice, and over the counter anti-inflammatory medication might be enough. If it's a more serious condition, further medical intervention might be required.\n\nRemember this advice is intended to be general in nature, you must consult with healthcare provider.",
    "859": "I'm truly sorry to hear about your health challenges. It's crucial that you discuss your current condition with your medical team including oncologists and urologists so they can develop a treatment plan that's tailored to your needs. If you've been diagnosed with lymphoma and kidney cancer, your team will consider various treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, or targeted therapies. Your specific treatment would depend on the stage and type of lymphoma and kidney cancer, your overall health, and other factors. I would also recommend seeking a second opinion from another specialist if you have any doubts. It's very important to maintain open communication with your doctors and be proactive in your care. Your emotional health is also crucial during this time, consider support groups or counselling services. Don't hesitate to seek help and discuss your concerns with your healthcare providers.",
    "860": "Hello, Your symptoms sound very much like prolapse, despite your past hysterectomy. The source could be a cystocele (bladder dropping down) or rectocele (rectum pushing into the vaginal space). It would be useful to see a urogynecologist for an examination. They can recommend whether exercises (pelvic floor physical therapy), a pessary (non-surgical device inserted into the vagina to support the pelvic organs), or even surgery would be the best treatment for you. Moreover, they can evaluate your lower back pain too.\nIn the meantime, you can try over-the-counter analgesics for the back pain and avoid heavy lifting or straining.",
    "861": "Hello, I understand how difficult this must be for you and your mother. The process for a lung transplant is complex and involves several criteria, one of which is the overall health status of the patient. Age, recurring infections, and underlying health conditions can play a role in determining candidacy. Given your mother's TB, her weakened immune system which would face further strain post-transplant is a concern. Also, the availability of donor lungs and the time frame to wait could potentially be quite long. \n\nMoreover, since your mother depends heavily on oxygen support and struggles with low oxygen levels, the risks associated with the surgery and her recovery post the transplant can be very high.\n\nIt's crucial you discuss with her healthcare provider in detail about all potential treatment options available. I would advise consulting a team of professionals specialized in pulmonary medicine and transplantation, who can provide a comprehensive evaluation of her case. They can guide you on the best feasible options and what could be done to improve her quality of life. Please remember, even outside of transplantation, there are other approaches to managing her symptoms and enhancing her comfort.",
    "862": "Hello Debra, your symptoms suggest that you experienced a severe case of Gastroenteritis or a similar upset. This is typically caused by bacterial or viral infection and presents with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and often a mild fever. In some cases, severe bouts of vomiting or diarrhoea can cause a drop in blood pressure leading to fainting and dizziness. \n\nFood poisoning can present in a similar way but is usually traced back to a suspicious food item. In your case, the chicken soup could be a potential cause but it's harder to establish a direct correlation. \n\nIn general, the symptoms tend to get better over a week or so, with progressive improvement each day. Dehydration can make your symptoms worse so it is important to stay well hydrated. If your symptoms persist or if you develop new symptoms like confusion, high fever, or bloody stools, you should consult a healthcare provider. \n\nFinally, the fainting episodes you experienced might be a matter of concern. While a one-off fainting episode may not be concerning, repeated episodes could point to a deeper issue, such as irregular heartbeat or other underlying conditions.\n\nWhile this dizziness might be a lingering symptom from your illness, it also could be something else. I suggest you monitor the symptoms and seek medical advice if it persists or worsens.\n\nPlease remember this advice is intended to be general in nature, you should contact your healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms in detail.\n\nTake care!",
    "863": "It sounds like your daughter may be dealing with a form of anxiety known as sleep or night anxiety that's often coupled with a phobia of the dark, known as Nyctophobia. It's important to know that fears and anxieties in children are common and treatable. \n\nYour first step should be to talk to her doctor or a mental health professional who specializes in childhood anxiety. They can provide you with tips and techniques to help your daughter cope with her fear and anxiety, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. \n\nYou can also make sure that her room is a comforting and secure place. If you don't have one already, consider getting a night light for her room, as this can help ease her fear of the dark. \n\nCognitive behavioral therapy has been found particularly useful in dealing with childhood anxieties. This includes techniques such as exposure to fear (gradually getting her used to sleeping alone in small steps) and equipping your daughter with relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or visualization exercises.\n\nLastly, maintaining regular sleeping routines and ensuring a physically active and mentally stimulating daily routine can help. Regular exercise helps reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality, while lack of mental stimulation during the day can lead to anxiety at night.\n\nAgain, it is crucial to approach this issue with empathy and patience. Never get upset with your daughter for her fears, as this will only increase her anxiety.

    "865": "Molluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection that causes raised, pearl-like papules or nodules on the skin. It is typically spread through direct contact with the skin of an infected individual or by touching objects that have the virus on them, such as towels, clothing or toys. While it can be transmitted through sexual contact, it is not exclusively a sexually transmitted disease. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the virus can spread through non-sexual contact like gym equipment, swimming pools, sharing towels etc. Also, the lesions might have been already present but not identified as molluscum contagiosum lesions until your partner went to the doctor. The correlation with unprotected sex might be coincidental. \n\nAs you've mentioned, there is a period of latency between the initial infection and the appearance of lesions which might be ranging from weeks to months. Your doctor's suggestion that your partner might have confused the lesions with ingrown hair and subsequently spread them through shaving is plausible. Regardless, if your partner has molluscum contagiosum, it is advisable to avoid any skin-to-skin contact until the lesions are completely resolved to avoid transmission.\n\nIf you've both been tested and you have no signs of the virus, then it would seem you were not the source of the infection. If you are still concerned, it would be good to have an open, respectful conversation with your partner to mitigate your fears. Also, it's important to maintain regular sexual health check-ups going forward.",

What you have sounds like a complex kidney cyst, given its size and the symptoms you're experiencing.\n\nIn some cases, larger kidney cysts can cause symptoms like pain, fever, or changes in urinary habits. In some cases, they can push on other organs causing discomfort. It's possible this is contributing to what you're feeling.\n\nThe next step, as your doctor mentioned, is the referral to Urology. They may need to remove the cyst or even the entire kidney, depending on various factors including the function, size, and whether there is any suspicion of it being something more serious such as cancer. \n\nBut, you should know that humans can live very healthy lives with just one kidney. In the case the kidney needs to be removed, the remaining kidney can handle the body's needs by adjusting its function as required.\n\nI would recommend that you attend your urology appointment prepared with questions and concerns to help you understand all your treatment options and their potential side effects. It's natural to be scared at this time, but getting comprehensive information about your situation can alleviate some of your fears.\n\nHave faith in your medical team and don't hesitate to voice your concerns with them - They're there to help you.",

    "868": "If your baby has no other symptoms such as fever, vomiting or abnormal behavior, and she's feeding well and gaining adequate weight, there typically isn't a cause for concern. Babies' stool can change color and consistency often, especially in the first year as their gut flora develops.\n\nThe administration of vaccines and the introduction of the probiotics could sometimes lead to changes in bowel movements in the short term. However, since it's been a few days without improvement, I would suggest continuing the probiotics as your doctor initially instructed and keep her hydrated.\n\nRemember to monitor her activity and feeding. If she appears sick, less active, less hungry, or if the diarrhea is increasing, keep in touch with your doctor or pediatrician to reassess her condition. Continue to breastfeed her often, as breast milk is the best and most complete form of nutrition for your young infant.\n\nIn the meantime, some potential causes for the green-colored stools can be consumption of more foremilk than hindmilk during breastfeeding or stool moving too quickly through the intestines (which can also happen with diarrhea). If you feel the breastfeeding pattern may be leading to her getting more foremilk, try nursing on one side for longer to ensure she gets to the hindmilk.\n\nAlways keep monitoring her health and contact your doctor when necessary.",

Please note that medications may take months or even years to work, during which time the gallstones could cause complications. If symptoms and pain persist, surgical intervention could be required. Given the size of the stone and the fact that you're experiencing continuous pain, it might be best to have the surgical procedure done as soon as possible. \n\nHowever, I understand that traveling to have the procedure done might not be immediate. If you are unable to undergo surgery at the moment and you are not experiencing severe symptoms such as high fever, severe nausea and vomiting, or yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice), you might be able to wait until May. \n\nPlease continue taking medications as prescribed by your local doctor.

    "870": "Hello, I understand your concern. What you're experiencing sounds like post-febrile telogen effluvium. This is a form of temporary hair loss that happens after a significant stress event, such as a severe illness like typhoid. The good news is that this condition is usually reversible. Your hair follicles have not been permanently damaged, they have been put into a resting state by the physiological stress your body experienced.\n\nRecovery can take several months as hair grows slowly - approximately 1 cm per month. As the hair lost during telogen effluvium was towards the end of its natural life cycle, it is normal for it to grow back thinner. Over time, it should return to its previous thickness. \n\nIt will be helpful to cater your diet towards hair recovery - a healthy diet can help your hair regrow. Nutrients particularly important for hair health include proteins, biotin, and vitamins A, C, D and E, along with minerals such as iron, zinc and selenium. \n\nYou can also consider using mild shampoos and avoid tugging or pulling at your hair. If you're comfortable doing so, you might want to avoid styles that could exacerbate the hair loss, like tight ponytails or braids. \n\nIf the problem continues, please consult a dermatologist who may prescribe a minoxidil lotion or other treatments. These treatments can help stimulate the hair follicles and promote new growth.\n\nPlease remember that recovery takes time and varies from",
    "871": "Hello, I understand how distressing such feelings can be specially when you are suffering from severe emetophobia. The sensation you're describing along with hot and cold flushes, and nausea could be a result of anxiety and panic. \n\nAnxiety can often cause feelings of nausea and other physical symptoms like headache, flushes or chills. It would be beneficial for you to practice some calming techniques such as deep breathing, mindfulness or progressive muscle relaxation when you start to feel this way.\n\nIt would be important for you to discuss these symptoms with your parents and consider visiting a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. Cognitive behavioral therapy can be very effective for phobias like emetophobia.\n\nRemember, it's okay to seek help and talk about your feelings. You're not alone in this.",
    "872": "Hello, Thanks for your query. Oncovite is a pharmacologically formulated dietary supplement designed specifically for patients who have been diagnosed with or are at a high risk of developing bladder cancer. The directions on the label of the Oncovite suggest that the proper dosage is one tablet daily, so I would recommend reaching out to your prescribing doctor on your current dosage of four tablets per day.\n\nThe role of vitamins and other nutritional supplements in preventing bladder cancer recurrence is still a subject of ongoing research and there's not a firm consensus in the medical community. Dr. Lamm's regimen seems to include larger doses but this may not be necessary or beneficial for all patients. Since you have completed your maintenance BCG treatment, I would advise that you discuss with your doctor about whether to continue, stop, or reduce the dosage of Oncovite. Please keep in mind it's important to follow your doctor's advice in these matters.",
    "873": "Hello, thank you for reaching out. Unwanted 72 is an emergency contraceptive pill and is meant for emergency purposes only. Taking it frequently can lead to menstrual irregularities but doesn't necessarily harm the reproductive system in the long term. However, repeated high doses of hormones can have other side effects like nausea, headache, mood changes etc. But when you stop taking these pills, your body should ideally return to its regular cycle over some time. That being said, safer regular methods of contraception are recommended if you're sexually active. When you plan for a baby, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, balanced diet, and regular check-ups will be beneficial. Please consult a gynaecologist for detailed discussion.",
    "874": "Hello, after an illness it is quite normal for children to be a bit weak or lethargic. It can take a few days for them to bounce back to their normal selves. Continue giving your child a balanced diet. Make sure she is drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. If she continues to be inactive or shows other symptoms such as a lack of appetite, persistent fatigue, or any new symptoms, please consult your doctor as this could indicate an ongoing infection or other health issue. It's very important not to self-medicate with antibiotics like Amoxycillin, as improper usage can lead to resistance and other potential issues. Always use antibiotics under the supervision of a healthcare provider.",
    "875": "Hello, it seems like a multitude of factors may be contributing to your symptoms. These factors include heavy alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, and lack of exercise. All these things can negatively affect your nervous system and circulation leading to symptoms like numbness in your hands and feet.\n\nNumbness at night could suggest a form of neuropathy, caused by damage to the nerves. Both smoking and heavy drinking can contribute to neuropathy. Smoking affects circulation and can cause peripheral artery disease, while comparatively alcohol has direct toxic effects on the nerves. \n\nYour high blood pressure should be regularly monitored and controlled under a doctor's guidance. Untreated or poorly-treated high blood pressure can lead to a host of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. \n\nIt is important that you adopt a healthier lifestyle to manage these risk factors better. Try to gradually cut back or quit smoking and limit alcohol intake. Regular exercise is highly recommended for reducing high blood pressure, improving circulation, and generally improving the wellness of your body. \n\nRemember, these changes might not reverse the damage completely, but they can certainly slow the progression and improve overall health. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and proper management of these symptoms.",
    "876": "Differentiating between salty taste and salty saliva could be a bit tricky, so let's break it down. Most often a salty taste in the mouth is due to dehydration or electrolyte imbalance, and sometimes it can be a side effect of certain medications. Salty saliva, while less common, can be caused by dehydration, Sjogren's syndrome(autoimmune condition), or salivary gland infections.\n\nGiven your situation, a couple of things might be contributing here:\n1. Canned vegetables typically have a much higher sodium content than fresh counterparts, which could be adding to your dietary sodium intake. Sodium can create a salty taste in your mouth.\n2. You mentioned a cavity filling fell out of your molar, leaving a big hole. Poor oral hygiene or infections (especially infections related to gums, teeth or oral surgical wounds) might result in a salty taste. If there is a bacterial overgrowth in the mouth, this can result in a salty secretion from the area of overgrowth.\n\nI would highly recommend seeing a dentist as soon as possible to attend to your molar. In the meantime worry about the salt in canned foods and try to brush your teeth and floss regularly to maintain good oral hygiene. Make sure to stay hydrated and consider using over-the-counter products for dry mouth if needed. If the salty taste persists, it would be a good idea to visit your physician for further investigation.",
    "877": "Hello, I can understand your concern. Often times, chest pain that is not related to the heart can be caused by conditions such as acid-reflux, inflammation of the cartilage that attaches the rib to the breastbone (costochondritis), or muscle strain. The pain in your arm and the weakness could possibly be related to a pinched nerve, possibly in your neck or upper spine (cervical spine). It could also be due to muscle strain. If the pain and weakness persist, it would be wise to consult a neurologist or a orthopedic surgeon for an accurate diagnosis. Pain and weakness in one arm should always be evaluated as soon as possible. In the meantime, avoid heavy lifting and sudden movements. You may take a painkiller like acetaminophen to relieve the pain. However, always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication regimen.",
    "878": "Hello, I understand how you feel and I empathize with your situation. Infertility can be a very frustrating condition and it is quite understandable that you feel anxious. If your gynecologists have confirmed that there is no medical issue with you, then the next step would indeed be for your husband to undergo a semen analysis. This is a routine and non-invasive examination that can reveal a lot about male fertility.\n\nThe fact that your husband already has a child does not necessarily mean that he couldn't have a fertility issue now. Male fertility can change over the years and can be impacted by various factors like health, lifestyle, age, etc.\n\nIt sounds like you need to communicate with your husband and express how you're feeling. It might be helpful to do this with the support of a counselor or in a setting where you both feel comfortable to discuss the issue openly. If after discussing, he is still unwilling, you may have to explore other options to conceive, like using a sperm donor.\n\nFinally, if you have been trying to conceive for more than a year without success, it might be a good idea to visit a fertility specialist (with or without your husband), just to discuss other possibilities and get a clear pathway for further action. Take care.",
    "879": "Hello, thank you for reaching out. Based on your description, it seems like you might be experiencing a post-operative infection on the extraction site, which could potentially cause nausea. But, it should be confirmed with an oral examination. The bad taste or odor could be due to food debris that has been trapped in the extraction socket or possibly a condition called 'dry socket' or 'alveolar osteitis'. This happens when a blood clot fails to form or is lost from the site which leaves the underlying bone and nerves exposed. This tends to happen a few days after the extraction, which matches your timeline.\n\nAdditionally, the nausea and the tight feeling in your throat might also be due to an idea of unwellness, a side effect of any medications you are taking, or due to infection. I'd advise you to rinse your mouth with warm salt water to help clear away any debris and promote healing. Avoid smoking and drinking through a straw while healing.\n\nHowever, it's very important you seek immediate medical attention. Please schedule an appointment with your dental surgeon for a thorough examination. They might need to prescribe an antibiotic or other intervention therapy to deal with an infection if present. Make sure to relay all of your symptoms to your dentist. I hope you get better soon!",
    "880": "These symptoms you're experiencing can be potentially related to issues with your inner ear or brain. Conditions such as vertigo, Meniere's disease, or vestibular neuritis could explain the dizziness and loss of balance. It's also possible that these are symptoms of migraines or other neurological conditions. These symptoms could also be stress or anxiety-related. \n\nRegardless, these are symptoms that should not be ignored, especially given their duration and severity. Please seek immediate medical attention. A healthcare professional should examine you to provide an accurate diagnosis and help manage these symptoms effectively. Remember not to drive or operate heavy machinery until this has been resolved, to protect yourself and others.",
    "881": "Hello, From what you are saying, it appears that you have one functional fallopian tube and your husband has low sperm motility. Although these factors can make conception more challenging, it certainly does not make it impossible. You can conceive through your one tube, and there are ways to address the issue of low sperm motility. \n\nIf you have been actively trying to conceive for over one year without success, it might be time to consider seeing a fertility specialist. They can help determine the cause of your difficulties and suggest appropriate treatment options. This could include intrauterine insemination (IUI), where sperm is placed directly inside your uterus to facilitate fertilization. Or, in-vitro fertilization (IVF) could also be considered, where eggs are harvested from your ovaries and fertilized by your husband's sperm in a laboratory, before being transferred back to your uterus. \n\nThere are also lifestyle changes that can be implemented to improve sperm health, including a healthier diet, regular exercise, reducing stress, quitting smoking (if applicable), and avoiding tight underwear. \n\nI recommend you to consult a fertility specialist. They can provide more specific guidance based on your individual medical history and current circumstances. \n\nBest of luck.",
    "882": "Hello, I can understand your concern. If the adjacent tooth is healthy, there's absolutely no need to pull it out for the sake of a bridge. Your idea of getting an implant for the loose tooth is a good one. Implants provide the closest thing to a natural tooth in terms of function and aesthetics. To close the gap, you won't even need to cap the other tooth - orthodontic treatment (braces or Invisalign) can bring the teeth together nicely without need for capping the healthy tooth. I would suggest getting a second opinion from another dentist. It's very important in dentistry to conserve as much of your natural dentition as possible.",
    "883": "From the symptoms you're describing, it sounds like you could be dealing with a condition known as infrapatellar branch of saphenous nerve (IBSN) neuritis, which is inflammation of a specific nerve in your knee. This condition often has the symptoms you describe - especially the pain when kneeling or brushing over the area, and sensitivity in a specific region.\n\nThe IBSN nerve provides sensation to the area of skin below the kneecap and can be compressed or injured resulting in these symptoms.\n\nTreatment for IBSN neuritis often involves rest, ice, and anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen (which you should use if you don't have any contraindications). Physiotherapy exercises can also help by stretching and strengthening the surrounding muscles, thereby reducing pressure on the nerve. \n\nOccasionally, if conservative treatment methods are not successful, a corticosteroid injection or surgery may be considered. But the need for this is rare.\n\nI would recommend seeing a healthcare professional to get a correct diagnosis and appropriate management.",
    "884": "Your symptoms probably suggest a condition named De Quervain's tenosynovitis. This condition causes pain on the thumb-side of the wrist. The pain may appear either gradually or suddenly, and it can travel the length of the thumb and forearm. Movements of the thumb or the wrist can escalate this pain. \n\nIt's commonly seen in people who use their thumbs repetitively such as throwing a ball, gardening, or lifting a child. The repeated strain can cause inflammation and swelling of the sheath that surrounds the two tendons controlling the movement of the thumb. \n\nFor now, I would recommend avoiding activities causing pain and swelling, applying cold to affected area to reduce swelling, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers like Ibuprofen, as long as you don't have any allergies or other contraindications. \n\nHowever, it's strongly advised to see a doctor, who will perform a physical exam and possibly recommend other therapies or, in rare cases, surgery.",
    "885": "Hello. I understand your concern. Starting with the sensitive tooth, if a dental X-ray showed no signs of infection or decay, the sensitivity could be due to gum recession or a thin enamel layer revealing the dentin. As for your swollen lymph nodes, this typically indicates an active infection in the body. Given that it's on the same side as your sensitive tooth, there's a chance it could be related even if no infection was apparent on the dental X-ray. \n\nThe itchy or numb feeling you describe could be related to the swelling or inflammation around those lymph nodes. The red and blotchy jawline could also be connected with the inflamed lymph nodes or could be an isolated skin condition. The sensation of a burnt tongue can be caused by various conditions from nutritional deficiencies, specifically for iron, folic acid, or vitamin B12, to certain oral conditions known as burning mouth syndrome. It could also be a side effect of your medication.\n\nGiven the range of symptoms you describe, I would advise that you seek medical attention. You may need an evaluation from both a dentist and a physician to determine the cause and appropriate treatment for your symptoms.",
    "886": "Hello Seth, thank you for your detailed question. From your description, it sounds like you might have experienced a superficial vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in a vein close to the surface of the skin. It can be caused by injury to a vein, long periods of inactivity (like your bed rest), or sometimes without any apparent cause.\n\nWhile this can be painful and take time to heal, it is generally not serious. The potential for a superficial vein thrombosis to travel and cause a more serious problem, like a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, is low. However, these risks are not zero.\n\nTo be on the safe side, you can do the following:\n\n1. Keep an eye on the area. If the pain worsens significantly, the area becomes red and hot, or you start to experience shortness of breath, seek medical attention right away.\n\n2. Keep active when possible. Regular movement has a protective effect against clots and can help prevent more from forming.\n\n3. Consider asking your doctor for a D-dimer blood test or ultrasound to help rule out the presence of a more serious blood clot.\n\n4. Discuss with your doctor if a short course of anti-inflammatory medication or blood thinners are appropriate for you.\n\nOf course, this advice is meant to be general in nature. Please consult with your healthcare provider directly about your specific situation. ",
    "887": "I'm sorry to hear about your chronic pain, it sounds like a complex issue that requires expert management.\n\nBased on your MRI findings, you have a combination of problems that may warrant a multi-disciplinary approach. It's not uncommon to see these degenerative changes in the spine, especially as we age, and unfortunately, they can occasionally cause symptoms like the ones you are experiencing.\n\nFirst of all, a pain management specialist can be important in your case. They can work with you to determine which medications (or combinations of medications) may help control your pain. This could include drugs like gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine, which are often used for neuropathic pain.\n\nIn addition, physical therapy is a critical part of managing your condition. A physical therapist can guide you on strengthening the core and back muscles to provide better spine stability, and on stretching to avoid stiffness and maintain mobility. \n\nFor the stenosis, steroid injections might be a considerable option. They can decrease swelling and inflammation in the spinal canal and potentially relieve the pressure on your nerves.\n\nIn some cases, surgical intervention might be suggested by a spine surgeon to help alleviate the symptoms caused by these structural issues, particularly if the pain is debilitating and not responding to conservative treatments. Procedures such as a discectomy or spinal fusion may be considered.\n\nThe management of multiple conditions affecting the spine can be challenging and it's crucial to work with a team of healthcare professionals who understand your situation.

    "888": "Hello, thanks for your question. Prior to valve replacement surgery, it is indeed generally recommended that patients resolve any potential sources of infection, including dental issues such as cavities. Although your aunt's dentist indicated that the tooth cavity won't be a problem since it is asymptomatic, there's a risk it might become active and subsequently lead to bacteria potentially entering the bloodstream. This could then lead to a heart valve infection, also known as endocarditis, especially as the new valve is healing. Based on current information, the safest course would be getting the cavity treated before undergoing valve replacement surgery to minimize any risk. However, the timing and invasiveness of this dental treatment should be carefully considered in the context of the urgency of the heart surgery. Your aunt's cardiologist and dentist should communicate closely to make the best decision.\n\nThis certainly is a complex situation and needs coordination between the cardiologist and dentist. I recommend scheduling another appointment with the dentist and possibly also the cardiologist to seek more advice on this matter. Wishing your aunt all the best for her upcoming procedures.",

A level of 575 mg/dl is quite high. You are doing the right thing by closely monitoring his blood sugar levels. You should aim to bring his blood sugar levels back to his target range, which is usually 70 to 130 mg/dl before meals and less than 180 mg/dl two hours after meals. However, as each diabetic's condition can be different, his target ranges might vary. \n\nThe symptoms of high blood sugar to look out for include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores or frequent infections, and loss of weight. Severe symptoms include confusion, drowsiness, difficulty in speech, seizures, or unconsciousness. \n\nStroke symptoms can include sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body, sudden confusion, trouble speaking, sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes, sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination, or sudden, severe headache with no known cause. Please immediately contact your healthcare provider or emergency services if any of these symptoms occur.\n\nPlease also consult your husband's healthcare provider regarding testing for ketones.

Regarding your upcoming surgery, the goal prior to any elective surgical procedure is to decrease the bacterial load as much as possible to minimize the risk of postoperative infection. Given that your surgeon is aware of your MRSA status and has advised you to continue antibiotics until after surgery, it suggests they are taking appropriate precautions. \n\nHowever, MRSA does increase the risk of surgical site infections, so it's essential to have a thorough discussion with your surgeon and the anesthesiologist about all risks and benefits associated with the surgery in your specific medical circumstances. \n\nIt's also prudent to promote general health: adequate rest, hydration, nutrition etc. to boost your immune system. \n\nRemember, in healthcare settings, follow diligent hand hygiene, sterilization and disinfection protocols to prevent further spread and contraction of MRSA.",

Hormonal imbalances or gynecological issues might be a reason too if she's a female. Sometimes, a more systemic issue like an autoimmune disease or a metabolic disorder could present with such symptoms.\n\nThough stress can manifest as physical symptoms, it would be prudent for her to get a second opinion if the symptoms are persistent and severely affecting her quality of life.

Using these medications together can increase the risk of side effects, including stomach issues. It's important to consult with your healthcare provider before taking these medications together. If your pain is worsening and cannot be managed with your current medication, you should reach out to a healthcare provider urgently.

Given that you smoke and have been experiencing chest pain, there may be concerns related to this habit, like conditions affecting your lungs or heart. However, since your pain also seems to move to many parts of your body, it may be due to musculoskeletal strain or even anxiety. \n\nThe heart rate you mention (resting heart rate of 50 bpm in the morning and 65 bpm in the daytime) is generally within normal range, especially for a person who is very athletic. Athletes often have slower heart rates because their hearts are very efficient.\n\nHowever, to evaluate this properly, I recommend you see a healthcare provider in person. They can do a full physical examination, take a detailed history of your symptoms, and conduct tests as necessary, for example ECG, chest X-ray, or blood tests. This would provide a more accurate evaluation of your medical status. Please make sure to mention all these symptoms and your smoking habit to the doctor.",

It's caused by hormonal changes and can be managed by maintaining proper hygiene, eating a balanced diet, and managing stress. \n\nHere are a few tips that could help you:\n\n1. Hygiene: Always keep the vaginal area clean and dry. Avoid using soaps or washes with strong fragrances as these can irritate the delicate balance of the vaginal flora.\n\n2. Diet: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains will help strengthen your immune system and prevent infections. Drinking plenty of water also helps in flushing out toxins from the body and maintaining the pH balance in the vagina.\n\n3. Clothing: Use cotton undergarments and avoid tight trousers as they can trap moisture and create a conducive environment for bacteria to grow.\n\n4. Stress Management: It has been found that stress can trigger leucorrhoea. Try to incorporate stress-busting activities in your daily routine like yoga, meditation or any other exercise that you enjoy doing.\n\nFor migraine, it's recommended that you identify the triggers (like certain foods, lack of sleep, stress, etc.) that cause the headaches and try to avoid them.

It would be important to get this re-evaluated by an orthopedist. She may need repeat X-rays and possibly other imaging to better understand what is going on. She may also need physical therapy once a proper diagnosis has been made.",
    "906": "Based on the symptoms you're describing, there could be several conditions that might be causing them. A low white blood cell count can sometimes signal an underlying health problem, such as an infection, immune disorder, or certain types of cancer. However, it can also be a side effect of treatments like chemotherapy. As for the low blood sugar levels, non-fasting hypoglycemia could result from certain medications, alcohol consumption, critical illnesses, hormonal deficiencies, or some kinds of tumors.\n\nThe fatigue and pallor could be tied to anemia, which might arise from a wide variety of causes including nutritional deficiencies (such as iron, B12, or folate), chronic diseases, or more rarely, bone marrow disorders. \n\nIt's important to remember that these are just possibilities, not diagnoses. Finding the exact cause would need a comprehensive clinical evaluation and further testing. Please consult with a healthcare professional who can review her symptoms, medical history, and lab results in detail. Don't delay seeking care; it's important to figure out what's causing these symptoms so an appropriate treatment plan can be established.",

In future, try setting reminders or alarms to help remember to take your medications on time.

Remember that stress can impact implantation as well, so try to stay calm and positive. Good luck!",
    "908": "Hello, \n\nI understand your concerns. The funny taste in the mouth (which is commonly described metallic in nature), and the numb and burnt sensation in the tongue are generally side effects of the medication antibiotic- amoxicillin that you are taking. \n\nRegarding the fatigue and tiredness, that can be normal when your body is healing from such a heavy infection as pneumonia. \n\nHowever, the chest pain on your left side and a slight cough can be residual symptoms from the pneumonia. Ideally your pneumonia should be better by now, but since you still have these symptoms, it's necessary to be re-evaluated. \n\nYour doctor might want to repeat a chest x-ray to verify the pneumonia has cleared completely, and the heart murmur and MVP need to be re-assessed as well, especially if you have been suffering from these symptoms a lot, and they are causing you distress. \n\nEven though the basic blood works are fine, your doctor might want to do more specific tests like cardiac enzymes, echocardiograms, stress tests, etc. to rule out a cardiac cause for these symptoms. \n\nRemember, it's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle with proper diet and regular exercise, which will aid in your recovery and improve your overall health. Always consult with your healthcare provider if symptoms persist or worsen.",
    "909": "Hello and thank you for reaching out. If you were diagnosed with TB of the right apex and are taking your medications (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Rimactazid) regularly as prescribed by your doctor, the chance of being contagious significantly reduces, usually after a few weeks of continuous treatment. Your symptoms of cough and cold may not necessarily mean that you are infectious. \n\nHowever, to be on the safe side, here are some important dos and don'ts:\n\n1) Do continue to take your medication exactly as prescribed and for the full duration even if you feel better. TB treatment takes a long time (usually around 6 months).\n  \n2) Do not skip doses or stop medication on your own. This can potentially make your TB more difficult to treat and cause drug resistance.\n   \n3) Do cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough, sneeze or laugh to prevent spreading germs. Dispose of the used tissue promptly and properly.\n   \n4) Don't spend a lot of time in closed-in spaces with other people. Try to avoid crowded places.\n\n5) Ensure you are maintaining a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet, adequate sleep and moderate exercise. This can help boost your immune system and help your body fight the bacteria.\n\nTalk to your healthcare provider about your new symptoms (especially the cough), they may want to re-test to ensure your treatment is working as it should be, or there may be something else causing your cough and cold",
    "910": "I'm sorry to hear about your discomfort. Ongoing stomach pain can be due to a number of factors such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gallstones, pancreatitis, and others. Over-the-counter medications like Pepto-Bismol can help with some types of stomach discomfort but might not be sufficient if the cause is something more serious. \n\nIt's difficult to diagnose without additional information like the exact location of the pain, whether it radiates to other areas, the nature (sharp, dull, cramping, burning), and if there are any other associated symptoms (vomiting, fever, changes in bowel movements). \n\nPlease stay hydrated, try a bland diet (avoiding spicy, fatty or heavy foods), and rest. If the pain is severe, has been going on for more than 24 hours, or if you have any additional symptoms like vomiting, severe bloating, blood in stool or fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Also, if you have any known medical conditions or are on other medications, please make sure those are evaluatuating properly. It's likely you may need a more detailed examination and possibly tests like an ultrasound or endoscopy.",
    "911": "Hello, thanks for providing the detailed information. Based on your symptoms these could be due to a few different conditions, including possibly gingivitis or a fungal infection such as oral thrush. Both of these conditions could be related to your braces, as they can harbor bacteria or yeast. \n\nIt could also be simply due to irritation from the braces, leading to inflammation and the bumpy texture. Or, it could be a normal variation or related to a non-harmful condition like oral lichen planus.\n\nHowever, because it's difficult to know for sure without examining you, I recommend you contact your dentist or orthodontist for an evaluation. If it's an infection, you'll likely need treatment. Even if it's not harmful, they might have suggestions for making you more comfortable or preventing it from becoming worse. Please don't delay, it's always best to get professional evaluation when you notice any changes in your mouth or gums to rule out any serious condition. ",

It seems like your sperm count is within normal range, but the motility of your sperm (active + sluggish) is only 20%, which is considered low as normally more than 40% of the sperm should be motile. Also, having 6-8 pus cells/HPF indicates an infection that might be affecting the sperm quality. The prescribed medicines like Fertimod, Evion, Mintera and CoQ are aimed to improve your sperm health and quality. These medicines have shown to improve sperm motility and reduce oxidative stress.\n\nIn order to further improve your sperm health, you should:\n\n1. Eat a diet rich in antioxidants (found in fruits, vegetables), omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish, walnuts), and vitamins especially vitamin C and E.\n\n2. Try to maintain a healthy weight. Obesity can negatively impact sperm health. Exercise regularly.\n\n3. Limit alcohol and avoid illegal substances and smoking as these can lower sperm count and motility.\n\n4. Stay well-hydrated.\n\n5. Try to avoid tension and stress.\n\n6.

    "914": "Hi, thanks for  reaching out. From your description, it sounds like you may have a skin condition such as dermatitis or eczema. These conditions can cause bumps that may leak fluid when scratched. This could also be insect bites or an allergic reaction to a certain substance. It’s advised not to scratch the area, as this can cause further inflammation and even an infection if the skin barrier is broken. Over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream may help with the itching, but it is important that you have a doctor examine your skin to diagnose the condition and provide appropriate treatment. Such skin conditions are not related to being a virgin or your sexual activity. It would be a good idea to see a doctor in person. If this is not possible, seek out online consultation with a dermatologist. It's always better to seek professional help. In the meantime, resist the urge to scratch, keep the area clean and dry, and avoid any substances or materials that seem to trigger this reaction.",
    "915": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about the discomfort you're experiencing. One simple home remedy is to use a warm compress. Soak a clean cloth in warm water and then apply it to your eye, specifically over the tear duct, several times a day. Be sure to use different parts of the cloth each time to avoid reintroducing any potential infection.\n\nAdditionally, gentle massage might also help. Using clean hands, apply slight pressure to the area from the corner of your eye, down towards your nose. This can sometimes help open the duct and facilitate drainage. \n\nHowever, keep an eye out for changes in symptoms such as increased redness, pain or swelling. If these occur, it's advisable to seek medical attention as it might indicate an infection and would then require medical treatment. Also, if the problem persists, an ophthalmologist may need to assess whether a minor procedure to open the tear duct might be necessary.",
    "916": "Yes, your symptoms could indeed be associated with a gastric problem. It sounds as though you may be experiencing bloating or distension of the stomach. This can be caused by excessive gas production, slow gastric emptying, or possibly a condition such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). When your stomach bloats it can put pressure on your diaphragm, which could cause difficulties in your breathing. \n\nIt's important to monitor when this issue typically occurs - note if it's after you eat or drink certain foods, or during periods of stress. Over the counter anti-gas medications or a mild, over-the-counter diuretic could offer some relief, though it's important to discuss their use with a healthcare provider. \n\nIn the meantime, you can also try incorporating more physical activity into your routine, eating smaller meals throughout the day, and avoid foods that are known to cause gas, such as beans, lentils, broccoli, onions, and carbonated drinks. \n\nPlease don't ignore this problem. If your symptoms persist, be sure to seek medical advice as it can be the sign of a more serious underlying condition such as a heart, lung or digestive tract disorder.",
    "917": "Hello Swastik, I'm sorry to hear about your discomfort. This type of prickly sensation is likely due to a condition known as cholinergic urticaria, a type of hives caused by changes in body temperature. \n\nIn management of this condition, the primary aim is to reduce symptoms. Staying in cooler environments and avoiding activities that can raise your body temperature may help. \n\nYour medication, Prednisolone, helps in decreasing the body's immune response to allergens, hence reducing the symptoms. Septilin enhances immunity and offers resistance against common allergens. However, long term use of corticosteroids can have side effects and your body can also become less responsive over time, as you're experiencing. \n\nYou may want to ask your doctor about alternatives such as antihistamines (like cetirizine, fexofenadine), leukotriene modifiers, or omalizumab (used in severe cases). Scratching or physical irritants can make your symptoms worse, so try to avoid this as well. \n\nKeeping a diary of your activities, foods and beverages you consume may help you identify specific triggers that worsen your symptoms. \n\nThis is a chronic condition but it can be managed efficiently with definite trigger avoidance and appropriate medications. You should discuss these alternatives with your local healthcare provider. Please remember online advice is intended to supplement, not replace a full medical evaluation. Hope you find relief soon!",
    "918": "Hello, both the concerns you mentioned can be symptoms of erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation, respectively. \n\nErectile dysfunction can be due to a variety of causes including stress, anxiety, depression, certain medications, alcohol or drug use, and some health conditions like diabetes or heart disease.\n\nPremature ejaculation is often caused by psychological issues such as anxiety, guilt, or high levels of sexual excitement.\n\nTreatment for these conditions usually involves a combination of medical and psychological therapies. Medication may be prescribed to help improve erectile function and delay ejaculation. Psychotherapy or counseling may be recommended to address any underlying psychological issues.\n\nBoth conditions are treatable, and many men have found successful treatments with the help of healthcare professionals. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't have specific doctor recommendations for your region, but I would suggest starting with your primary care doctor or a urologist. If they think it's appropriate, they could refer you to a specialist such as a urologist or a mental health professional.",
    "919": "I am sorry to hear about your daughter's repeated chest infections. Frequent use of antibiotics can, unfortunately, lead to antibiotic resistance, where the drugs become less effective because the bacteria they are targeting learn how to resist them. This doesn't mean that your daughter's body would be immune but that the bacteria causing the infections may no longer be sensitive to the antibiotics. \n\nBronchiolitis and asthma can make a young child more susceptible to chest infections. What's crucial is that your doctor works on a regimen to control your daughter's asthma as effectively as possible. That might include controller medications like inhaled corticosteroids. \n\nAlso, practicing good hygiene (like frequent hand washing), staying up-to-date with vaccinations, and avoiding tobacco smoke exposure can help prevent respiratory infections. \n\nIf your daughter's symptoms persist or worsen, it might be time to revisit her doctor or seek a second opinion on her treatment plan to better manage her conditions and hopefully reduce the frequency of these chest infections.",

In some cases, it may be a sign of an infection, like an anal fissure or streptococcal dermatitis.\n\nHere are a few suggestions:\n1. Remind your daughter to use gentle, unscented solid or liquid soap and warm water for cleaning, and to pat the area dry rather than rubbing.\n2. Apply a zinc oxide diaper cream to the area to act as a barrier against irritation.\n3. Over-the-counter creams with 1% hydrocortisone could help if the area is very inflamed or irritated, but don’t use these for more than a week without talking to a doctor.\n4. If her stools are hard, increasing fibre and fluid intake can help.\n5. Loose cotton underwear worn instead of tight fitting pants or synthetic materials can help reduce irritation.\n\nIf these measures do not help relieve her symptoms within a week, or if her symptoms worsen, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider to properly diagnose the issue and ensure it isn't something more serious. It might be contagious if her cousin had the same issue. Both of you should maintain good hygiene to avoid spreading it to others.

The cost for gallbladder surgery, also known as a cholecystectomy, can vary greatly based on several factors, such as the region where you live, whether the surgery is open or laparoscopic, and the specific hospital or clinic where the procedure is performed.

Your lung pain and shortness of breath may be related to your long term smoking habit, possibly indicating conditions such as COPD or lung cancer. The swollen lymph nodes need investigation to rule out conditions like lymphoma.\n\nLow blood sodium, or hyponatremia, can cause symptoms like headache and dizziness. It's crucial to find the cause of this - possibilities range from kidney or heart problems to hormonal imbalances.\n\nThe findings in your stomach and duodenum could suggest gastritis or peptic ulcers, possibly due to Helicobacter pylori infection, or misuse of NSAIDs.\n\nI suggest you consult a multidisciplinary team to further investigate your symptoms, this could include a pulmonologist, gastroenterologist, endocrinologist and possibly a hematologist. You may need a bronchoscopy, endoscopy and more detailed hormonal tests, along with monitoring of your blood sodium levels.\n\nLastly, quitting smoking is an excellent decision and will have a positive impact on your overall health.

    "923": "Hello, thanks for reaching out. Semen typically liquefies, or turns from a gel-like substance into a more water-like substance, within 20 to 30 minutes of ejaculation. If the semen does not liquefy within this time frame, it may suggest an issue with the seminal vesicles or the prostate, which are responsible for secreting the proteins required for liquefaction.\n\nLong-standing diabetes can potentially impact the prostate's health and thus affect the liquefaction time. However, there may be other causes as well, such as infection or other prostate or seminal vesicle issues.\n\nA delayed liquefaction time can possibly affect fertility, as it may hinder sperm motility, meaning it's harder for the sperm to move and reach an egg for fertilization.\n\nI would suggest consulting with your doctor. They may wish to order further investigations to determine the cause of your prolonged liquefaction time. If an infection is indeed found to be the cause, antibiotics could be used to treat it. If prostate issues are discovered, medications could be used to help improve prostate health.\n\nWhile this can be a concern, it doesn't necessarily equate to infertility. There are treatments and strategies that can be used to assist with conception, even if semen liquefaction is an issue. \n\nRemember, every patient is unique so be sure to consult with your healthcare provider for the best course of action.",
    "924": "Hello and thank you for reaching out. It sounds like your back pain is severe and you have been using certain medications for this and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, self-medicating is not always the best solution and may not treat the root cause of the problems.

It's best to see a doctor or physical therapist to evaluate the best plan of action for your back pain, which could include exercises, posture improvement, or other treatments. \n\nFor your gastric problem, it's good that you're taking steps like the use of Mucaine gel, but long-term it may be beneficial to make dietary adjustments. Avoid spicy, greasy, and acidic foods and eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of large ones. Try to stay upright after eating and don't go to bed right after meals. \n\nIf these symptoms continue or worsen, it's important to see a gastroenterologist to further evaluate your symptoms. Sleep well, stay hydrated, and avoid stress. All these can significantly contribute to back and gastric health.",

However, with a starting blood pressure of 150/100, taking 25mg of Captopril twice daily, as you did, is not unreasonable. That being said, everyone responds to medication a bit differently and finding the right dosage often involves some degree of trial and error. You should monitor your blood pressure regularly and reach out to your healthcare provider for necessary adjustments. Do not increase or decrease the dose on your own.

    "931": "Hello. Following surgical removal of wisdom teeth, it is common to experience some numbness or unusual sensations in the lower lip and chin for a while. This is due to the close anatomical relationship of the roots of the lower wisdom teeth with the Inferior alveolar nerve, an important sensory nerve in the jaw. The weird sensations can make you become more aware of the normal anatomy of your lip, such as salivary glands, fat or minor blood vessels which you interpret as 'vein like things'. \n\nHowever, if your symptoms worsen or persist after surgery, it's possible that you may have incurred some nerve damage during the procedure. This might be due to inflammation or bruising, or in relatively rare cases, the nerve might have been accidentally severed. However, with time these nerves usually regenerate and sensation gradually returns to normal. \n\nThat being said, with your described symptoms of constant pressure, burning, and unusual sensations when smiling, it is advisable to seek immediate consultation with your surgeon or depending upon their directions, with a neurologist. They can evaluate the extent of nerve damage, and provide appropriate treatments, which could range from medications to manage your symptoms, to nerve repair surgery, if necessary.\n\nIn the meantime, over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen can be used to manage your pain, unless contraindicated.

Always remember to use a good sunscreen daily, even when indoors, as any sun exposure can make hyperpigmentation worse.\n\nMeanwhile, discuss with your dermatologist the possibility of using other alternatives such as vitamin C serums, azelaic acid, or other non-hydroquinone based lightening creams. Procedures like microdermabrasion, laser treatments or chemical peels could be effective as well. But always proceed under the supervision of your dermatologist. Lifestyle changes like reducing sun exposure and ensuring you get enough vitamins in your diet, especially vitamins C, can also help.\n",
    "941": "Hello, thank you for your query. These reddish, swollen bumps could be caused by a number of things such as ingrown hairs, folliculitis, or even abscesses.

    "942": "Hello, the symptoms you describe might be due to several conditions like low blood pressure, inner ear disorders, anemia, dehydration, or even anxiety. \n\nIt's also crucial to consider more severe conditions such as heart diseases or neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. \n\nI strongly recommend you see a healthcare provider in person if these symptoms continue or worsen. You might need a full physical examination, blood tests and possibly imaging to identify the accurate cause. It's important not to ignore these symptoms, especially if they are occurring frequently. \n\nMeanwhile, make sure you stay hydrated, have regular meals to maintain blood sugar levels, and get enough rest. Don't stand up too quickly from sitting or lying down, as this can lead to feeling faint or unsteady. \n\nPlease remember that it's impossible to provide an accurate diagnosis online – do reach out to healthcare professionals in person.

    "943": "Hi Sumitha, thanks for reaching out. It sounds like you are taking all the proper steps to conceiving. Susten 300mg is generally given to support the luteal phase of your menstrual cycle post ovulation and help in the maintenance of early pregnancy if you conceive. Not having a menstrual cycle in July could be due to various reasons including stress, changes in weight, or hormonal imbalances. As your thyroid levels are normal, that's a good sign. \n\nPlease remember that it often takes a year or more for completely healthy couples to conceive. Your healthcare provider is the best person to help you understand why you are not conceiving, but typically they might suggest fertility treatments after a year of trying without success. It's also important both you and your partner get checked. Male infertility also contributes to a couple's inability to conceive in about half the cases. \n\nMoreover, lifestyle can also impact fertility. So, maintain a balanced diet, regular exercise, avoid stress, alcohol, smoking, and maintain a healthy BMI. Please follow the instructions given by your doctor. Keep your patience, continue your medication and remain positive.",
    "944": "Hello and thank you for explaining your situation. \n\nThe lump you are seeing is likely a dental abscess which can occur as a result of a long-standing dental caries or cavity. It appears that the infection from the tooth has spread to the gums. If left untreated, it can affect the developing permanent tooth and may spread to other areas leading to serious complications.\n\nThe recommended treatment options generally depend on the extent of the tooth decay and the condition of the tooth. If the decay is too severe or has affected the tooth's pulp, extraction might be the most effective treatment to fully address the infection and protect your child's oral health. It is important to remember that your child's baby teeth work as space savers for the permanent adult teeth, and losing one prematurely could lead to space loss and crowding of the permanent teeth.\n\nHowever, in certain cases where the tooth is largely intact, a procedure known as pulpotomy (partial root canal therapy) can be considered to try and save the child's tooth.\n\nUltimately, the decision depends on many factors including the child's age, extent of decay, cooperation level during procedures, and more. It would be advisable to get a second opinion if you are uncertain about the extraction.\n\nIf you decide to proceed with the extraction, the dentist might consider a space maintainer to save the space for the unerupted permanent tooth.\n\nThis advice is based on general dental principles. You should discuss these options with your dentist before reaching to a final decision.",
    "945": "Hi there, I understand your concerns. After stopping birth control, it can take some time for your body to return to a regular menstrual cycle. It's also possible that your periods may be irregular for a while. However, if you're having unprotected sex and your periods have not returned, it's possible that you may be pregnant. \n\nEarly signs of pregnancy can include a missed period, frequent urination, tender breasts, fatigue, nausea, and changes in appetite. However, these symptoms aren't definitive proof of pregnancy as they can also be symptoms of other conditions or responses to changes in your hormone levels. The only certain way to know if you're pregnant is by taking a pregnancy test.\n\nI understand your fear of disappointment if the test is negative, but finding out sooner rather than later is beneficial for both your health and the course of your potential pregnancy. If you're pregnant, you'll need to start prenatal care. If you're not pregnant and your periods have not returned, you may need to consult with a doctor to determine if there's another issue affecting your periods. Therefore, I'd recommend you to conduct a home pregnancy test or schedule an appointment with your health care provider.\n\nRemember, it's completely okay for it to take time to conceive, this is entirely normal and you're not alone.

    "947": "Hello Sri,\n\nYour MRI report suggests that you have some degree of disc bulge at the L4-L5 level which is mildly pressing on the nerve roots. This might be the cause of your lower back pain. The Schmorl's nodes and the hyperintense signal in the S1 vertebra are incidental findings and usually do not cause symptoms.\n\nFor back pain, the general line of treatment includes:\n- Physical therapy exercises to improve flexibility, strength and stability.\n- Pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs to manage pain.\n- In some cases intervention such as nerve blocks, epidural steroid injections or surgery might be considered.\n\nThe underlying cause of your knee pain would need to be confirmed. If it is related to the same nerve that is getting compressed in your spine, then managing the spinal issue might help reduce the knee pain. If the pain is not related, then a separate evaluation will be required.\n\nHowever, it would be best to discuss these results with your doctor or a spine specialist for a customized and effective treatment plan based on your specific symptoms and health history.\n\nRemember to always maintain good posture and engage in regular fitness activities to keep the back muscles strong and flexible, which will help in managing lower back pain. \n\nBest wishes for your health.",

Given your son's ongoing metabolic health issues and pending diagnosis, it's important to inform any healthcare providers about his condition and current medications, especially because some medicines could indeed impact the metabolism of his current medication, L-Carnitine. Certain antibiotics, such as erythromycin and azithromycin, can interact with L-Carnitine. You should avoid Ibuprofen in your son's case, as it can disrupt mitochondrial function, which is particularly important in children with metabolic disorders.\n\nWhile it's usually safe to give acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain and fever, other medications should ideally be discussed with your son's specialist before they are administered. Regardless, when you take your son to urgent care, it is critical that you share his medical information and ongoing treatment with the healthcare providers there. They need complete information for them to decide upon the best course of treatment.\n  \nLastly, monitor your son closely when he's unwell. Children with metabolic conditions can decompensate quickly with any illness. Make sure he is hydrating well and not losing too much fluid if he's also having symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea.",

However, cramping can also indicate other things, such as an impending period or stress, as you've mentioned. Fatigue and sleeplessness can also affect your cycle.\n\nGiven the unclear results on the test, I suggest retaking the test after a few days (preferably first thing in morning as HCG is most concentrated in morning urine) or scheduling an appointment with a healthcare provider for a blood test, which is the most accurate sensing method.\n\nIt's always best to confirm and consult with a healthcare provider.",

They may recommend an endoscopy, abdominal ultrasound or other imaging to assess the stomach and other digestive organs. In the meantime, you should avoid smoking, alcohol, NSAIDs (like ibuprofen), and spicy foods which can cause irritation. You should also try to eat small frequent meals instead of large ones and avoid lying down immediately after eating.

If you're experiencing pain in your chest every time you eat or drink, it could be because of a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD occurs when stomach acid frequently flows back into the tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus). This backwash (acid reflux) can irritate the lining of your esophagus and cause the kind of discomfort you're experiencing. \n\nAnother potential cause is esophageal spasm, a disorder of the esophagus that can cause symptoms such as chest pain and difficulty swallowing food and fluids. \n\nIn rare cases, such symptoms might also be caused by serious conditions such as heart disease, even if the pain is triggered by swallowing.\n\nGiven your symptoms, I strongly advise you seek a medical evaluation as soon as possible.

This pattern is commonly seen in polycystic ovarian disease (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that can cause the ovaries to become enlarged with small cysts on the outer edges.\n\n2. The uterus is within normal limits: This means that the shape, size, and position of your uterus appear normal, without any visible abnormalities.\n\nYour symptoms of abdominal pain and bloating can be associated with PCOS, as well as many other conditions.

As you are actively trying to conceive, I would also recommend to maintain healthy lifestyle habits such as balanced nutrition, regular exercise, and avoid alcohol and cigarettes. Keep in mind that it might take several months to conceive, so try not to stress and enjoy this time with your partner. If you have not been able to conceive after a full year of trying, that's when we typically recommend to seek the help of a fertility specialist. Good luck with your journey to parenthood!",

You should follow up with the pediatrician in person and discuss further steps, as your child may need investigations to discover the source of recurrent infections. \n\nAlso, if your child's current regimen is not controlling the symptoms, it might be necessary to adjust the medication or explore other possible causes. It is best carried out in direct consultation with your treating doctor or pediatrician. \n\nPlease do not start, stop, or change any medication without discussing with a healthcare provider, as the medicines need to be tailored to each specific child's condition, weight, and overall health.",
    "976": "While waiting for your doctor to get back to you, it's important to continue feeding attempts, but carefully monitor your baby for signs of choking or distress. She may be spitting up or choking due to the flow of milk from the bottle being too fast, even though it's a slow flow nipple. Try burping her more frequently during feedings to ensure any trapped air is released which may be causing her discomfort. \n\nIt's also common for newborn babies to refuse the breast, nipple shield, or the bottle at times due to nipple confusion. It would be helpful when trying to breastfeed, to make sure that both you and your baby are calm and relaxed as the process can sometimes take a while. \n\nLastly, it's perfectly normal for a baby to cry in the early weeks as they are still very new to this world and crying is their way of communicating. \n\nBut please make sure to follow up with your pediatrician to rule out any possible medical issues. If your baby seems really distressed, or the choking incidents become more frequent, please take her to the emergency room. Your baby's health and safety is of utmost priority.",

Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBCs are slightly low, potentially indicating anemia. Your platelets aren't fully described in your message (standard platelet count is in thousands, not units like 17.6) but if it's low it can lead to bruising and bleeding easily. \n\nWithout further information, I can't tell you definitively whether you should be worried because these tests must be interpreted in the context of your symptoms, medical history, and other diagnostic information.

    "979": "Hello, I can understand you might be worried. The chances of getting pregnant from these circumstances seem to be very low. Although it's possible for semen (including precum) to have enough sperm to cause pregnancy, the fact that he wiped off the condom and didn't fully insert before switching reduces this risk. It's also important to note that pregnancy can only happen if you are on your fertile window. If you're not sure when you ovulate, consider monitoring your cycle or using ovulation kits to have a better understanding. However, to be safer next time, if a condom is put on incorrectly, it's best to use a new one. If you are very anxious or if your next period is delayed, a pregnancy test can confirm for you if you are indeed pregnant or not.",

The periodic bleeding could be due to urinary tract infections, trauma, stones in the urinary tract, or some types of medication. In some cases, it can also be a sign of more serious conditions such as bladder cancer or kidney disease. Other symptoms may accompany the bleeding, such as painful urination or lower abdominal pain. I recommend your husband to be seen by a urologist or primary care doctor as soon as possible to determine the exact cause of this bleeding. Remember, it's crucial not to ignore these symptoms, as they could signal a more serious underlying condition.",

It would be best for your daughter to see her healthcare provider for a proper evaluation, which may include a physical examination or even a biopsy. They can then provide targeted treatment. It's crucial not to attempt any self-treatments like squeezing the bump or using over-the-counter products without a professional's advice. With any skin change, it's essential to get it checked out, especially if it's growing and has lasted for an extended time. Modify as per your preferences and medical ethics.",
    "982": "Hello, what you're describing in your friend especially the lump and the associated pain with pressure indicates a hematoma, which is the collection of blood outside the vessel. It is caused by a rupture in the wall of the vein, artery, or blood vessel. This can happen after a blood draw, especially if the needle goes through the vein. She should monitor it closely, but there's typically no major concern. It should resolve on its own over time as your body will gradually clot and reabsorb the blood.\n\nIf the area continues to be painful, warm compresses can help to alleviate some discomfort and speed up the recovery process by increasing the circulation of that area. It's also crucial that your friend refrains from vigorous activities that might aggravate the hematoma.\n\nHowever, if the lump continues to grow, if the pain escalates, or if she starts to experience symptoms like a heavy arm, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, she should consult with a healthcare professional immediately because these might indicate a more serious issue like a blood clot.",

    "984": "Hello and thank you for your question. Fenistil is an antihistamine, which is sometimes used to help with asthma symptoms, although it is not a typical asthma medication. Generally, it's used to lessen the allergic reactions that can trigger asthma symptoms. \n\nThis being said, the duration of medication completely depends upon your child's condition. It would be incorrect to advise further without a proper examination or more detailed medical history. Ideally, you should make an appointment with your doctor to reassess your daughter's condition. They will be able to guide you on when and how to stop the medication.\n\nRemember, asthma is a long-term condition that can require periodic adjustments in medication. It's important to have regular follow-ups with your healthcare provider to manage it effectively. \n\nIf she has been diagnosed with asthma, she may need to be on a longer-term asthma prevention injection or inhaler rather than an antihistamine. A pulmonary doctor would be the most appropriate to discuss these kinds of treatments with you. \n\nUntil your doctor's visit, do not stop or alter medication doses without speaking to them first. Be sure to monitor your daughter's symptoms closely and seek immediate medical attention if they worsen.",

This would typically cause symptoms such as fatigue, fever, cough, and congestion. Chest discomfort or pain and shortness of breath can also occur with these conditions, often related to the coughing. However, it's always important to ensure that chest discomfort isn't a sign of something more serious, such as a heart condition.\n\nYour doctor would need to evaluate you to make the determination based on your history, symptoms, and potential risk factors. However, generally, if you are not experiencing severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, severe chest pain, or increasing symptoms, and you do not have any high-risk medical conditions (such as heart disease, immunosuppression, etc.), it may be reasonable to wait until Monday to be seen.\n\nNonetheless, given the complexity of possible diagnoses, if you're unsure or if your symptoms worsen, it's always best to seek medical attention sooner rather than later. If you develop any severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing or severe chest pain, you should seek urgent medical attention.",
    "986": "Hello, thank you for your question. Based on the symptoms you described, this seems to be Allergic Rhinitis, which is an allergic response to specific allergens, in your case may be certain smells, dust, or temperature changes. It is usually more pronounced in the morning and might cause a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, watery or itchy eyes, and itching in the ears. \n\nTaking an antihistamine like cetirizine is often the first line of treatment for symptoms, and it can be quite effective. However, if the symptoms persist or intensify, you may need to consider other options like steroid nasal sprays, decongestants, or other allergy medications. \n\nAnother treatment option is immunotherapy (allergy shots or under-the-tongue tablets) that can help alter your immune response and reduce the severity of your allergic reactions over time. \n\nThese symptoms, if untreated, can lead to sinusitis, sleep disturbances, and even asthma. Furthermore, constant exposure to allergens over an extended period can result in Chronic Rhinosinusitis, with prolonged inflammation in your nose and sinuses.\n\nTo diagnose your condition with certainty and to start adequate treatment, I recommend you see an allergist, who can conduct skin or blood tests to identify the specific allergens that are causing your symptoms.

Fefol-Z is a multivitamin and multimineral capsule that is typically prescribed to patients, especially women, who need more nutrients due to conditions like anemia. The folic acid in Fefol-Z is important for the body to produce healthy red blood cells and can be particularly useful if you're trying to conceive, as it's crucial for the proper development of the baby's neural tube.

PCOS can lead to issues with fertility and can also cause weight gain and hair loss. Your doctor may advise some tests for diagnosis. Keeping a healthy lifestyle with well balanced diet and regular exercise as you are doing is an integral part of managing such conditions. \n\nThis should be used as part of your broader treatment plan that your doctor would advise based on the diagnosis. You should continue to follow their advice and keep them informed about all your symptoms or any changes in your condition.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one such condition that causes intense, brief episodes of dizziness, generally associated with moving the head. The persistence of your neck pain may also suggest a musculoskeletal issue, possibly stemming from your posture or sleeping position. \n\nI would recommend you to seek medical attention immediately, as these issues require further investigation. A healthcare professional can evaluate you and may order specific tests or imaging to confirm a diagnosis. They may also recommend certain exercises, physiotherapy or medications depending on the findings.\n\nDo monitor other symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath or trouble walking, as they require immediate medical assistance.

    "990": "Hello, Based on your history, it sounds like the irritations you're experiencing could be related to the tobacco usage. Tobacco, both smoked and chewed, is known to cause irritation to the oral mucosa. Once you've stopped using it, your tissues are recovering and can occasionally exhibit symptoms like you're describing.\n\nInflammation or minor irritations can take time to heal, especially in the mouth where the healing process can be slowed due to eating, drinking, and speaking. It's encouraging that your dentist didn't find any signs of cancer or serious conditions but keep a close eye on your symptoms.\n\nNighttime flare-ups could be resulting from dehydration, as our saliva production decreases during sleep which encourages the mouth to dry out. Remember to stay well hydrated and maintain good oral hygiene. Rinsing with warm salt water can also soothe irritated tissues.\n\nConsider following up with your dentist if symptoms persist or worsens. In the absence of visible symptoms like sores or ulcerations, it may be a subclinical irritation which could take time to subside.\n\nIt's always important to remember that chronic tobacco use does increase the risk of oral cancer and other related problems, so the decision to stop using it is beneficial. I would encourage you to stick to the plan of discontinuing its use.\n",

Chest pain and cough: Smoking for many years increases the risk of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. However, chest pain could also be related to heart disease. A full examination, including chest x-ray and ECG, may be needed. Quitting smoking is absolutely essential.\n\n2. Kidney stones: The treatment for kidney stones depends on the size of the stone, what it's made of, whether it's causing pain, and whether it's blocking your urinary tract. Further tests such as an ultrasound may be needed. You should increase your fluid intake until your urine is light yellow.\n\nI recommend visiting a specialist in person for a more complete evaluation. It's not safe or legal for me to prescribe medication online. You might need medication such as antibiotics, painkillers, anti-inflammatory drugs, or medication to help you quit smoking.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to seek timely medical attention.

    "992": "Hello,\n\n1. With chief complaints of irregular periods, history of miscarriage and insulin resistance, it sounds like you're suffering from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). This is a common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Your doctor correctly prescribed metformin (Glucophage), which is used to manage insulin resistance, and birth control medications (Diane 35 or Progyluton) for menstrual cycle regulation. The IUI procedure your doctor recommended is a part of a fertility treatment, particularly when ovulation problems like absence of egg release occurs due to PCOS. The medicines prescribed (Serophene and possibly injections) aim to stimulate your ovaries to aid in ovulation. If it is indeed a case of ovarian cyst, it is important to monitor its size and characteristics.\n\n2. As for a good Gynaecologist in Chennai, I do suggest you to do some personal internet research or perhaps seek suggestions from peers who had experiences on the same problem, as I'm not capable of recommending any specific practitioners.\n\nRemember, it's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and regular follow-ups with your doctor.

Given your history, especially the presence of potential polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and the fact that clomiphene and IUI attempts haven't resulted in pregnancy, laparoscopy could be a sensible next step. Laparoscopy is a diagnostic surgical procedure which allows your doctor to look at the ovaries and fallopian tubes directly and see whether there are any abnormalities such as cysts, scar tissue or blockages that could be preventing pregnancy. With PCOS, it's important to manage related symptoms as well. A good diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can help as well. If you still have concerns, don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from another fertility specialist. Don't lose hope; many women with PCOS are still able to conceive with the correct management and treatment.",

Because she won't stand on it and the pain is present even with light pressure, it is advisable to get her evaluated by a healthcare professional. The color changes could be due to bruising or a hematoma (blood collection), but in some cases, could potentially indicate a more serious injury such as a bone fracture. \n\nFor now, apply a cold compress to the area to help with swelling and give her an age-appropriate dose of over-the-counter pain medication like Children's Tylenol. Then try to seek medical attention as soon as possible to ensure the injury is not serious. \n\nEven if this doesn't turn out to be a fracture, it's still important for her to be checked out for possible severe soft tissue injury, contusion or hematoma. The healing process of these injuries should also be monitored by a healthcare professional to avoid complications.",
    "995": "Hello. The swelling could be due to several reasons. It could be because of an abscess, hemorrhoids, or a possible complication of the chronic fissure such as a sentinel pile. Given the chronic nature of your anal fissure and the emergence of this new symptom, it may be time to consider further intervention, possibly including surgery. Surgery for anal fissures involves a small cut in the anal sphincter muscle to reduce tension and allow the fissure to heal. This is typically considered if all other treatments have failed and the problem persists for more than a year. In the meantime, continue maintaining a fiber-rich diet, use stool softeners, and sitz baths to relieve discomfort. This is a difficult problem to manage I'm sure, but try to stay hopeful. New treatment approaches are being researched and developed all the time. Please consult with your primary healthcare provider or a surgeon for a complete evaluation.",
    "996": "Hello. Don't panic. When first starting the contraceptive pill, it can take a few months for your body to get used to the new hormone levels and for your periods to get into a regular pattern. The brownish discharge that you noticed might be some old blood. This can be an entirely normal side effect as your body adjusts to the new hormone level and is not necessarily a sign of pregnancy. \n\nThe itching could be due to several reasons such as allergic reactions to soaps, lotions, or detergent, yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis or other sexually transmitted diseases. If the itching persists or is accompanied by other symptoms like discharge, redness, burning, you should definitely talk to your doctor or a nurse, or go to a sexual health clinic. \n\nThe nausea might be side effects of the pill. Some people experience mild symptoms like nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness and mood swings when they start taking the contraceptive pill. These usually settle down in a few days or weeks.\n\nHaving said all this, anyone who's having sex could get pregnant, and using contraception (like the pill) can help reduce this risk. If you're worried about pregnancy, you might want to consider having a pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests are very reliable and you can do a test on the first day of a missed period. \n\nRemember that nowhere is it safe to have unprotected sex at your age.

    "997": "Hello Venkat, psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that requires long-term management. The treatment goal is to reduce inflammation and to control the shedding of the skin. The white color change on your skin is likely due to the ongoing treatment, which typically causes the skin to peel or flake off. Once you stop the ointment, the reddish color return indicates the inflammation is not fully under control. It's very important to follow your prescribed medication routine and not to stop treatment abruptly without consulting with your healthcare provider. The choice of treatment also depends on the severity of your psoriasis and other aspects of your health. I recommend you to make an appointment with your dermatologist to discuss your ongoing skin changes. They may adjust your treatment plan or suggest other management therapy accordingly.",
    "998": "It is indeed a positive sign that the symptoms of periodontitis - such as swelling, redness, and bleeding of gums - have subsided after treatment. The gaps you are observing are due to the gum tissue loss, which is unfortunately a permanent loss since gum tissue does not grow back.\n\nFood particles getting trapped into these gaps might make you prone to tooth decay or secondary periodontitis if not cleaned properly. To circumvent this, ensure that you are brushing and flossing vigilantly after every meal. Other aids such as interdental brushes might also be beneficial to remove food particles from these gaps. \n\nThe yellowness and plaque formation highlights the need for a sound oral hygiene regimen, as they are signs of bacterial accumulation. Consider having professional cleaning/ scaling at regular intervals, perhaps every 6 months, to maintain oral hygiene and keep plaque under control.\n\nI would advise you to speak to your dentist who might discuss further options such as reconstructive techniques - for instance, GTR (Guided Tissue Regeneration), gum grafts or proposing different prosthetic options to fill these gaps. This can help in maintaining structural integrity and prevent food lodgement.\n\nIn summary, meticulous oral hygiene and regular dental follow-ups are essential in your case.",

The symptoms you're experiencing - fluctuating body temperature, headache, decreased appetite, stomach pain, and diarrhea - all point to your digestive system being affected. Other potential symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and dehydration. \n\nIt's crucial to hydrate yourself adequately during such episodes, taking small sips of water or oral rehydration solution to replace the electrolytes lost due to diarrhea. Eating a bland diet might also help until your symptoms improve. \n\nHowever, as your symptoms appear quite severe and have persisted for a few days now, I advise that you seek immediate medical attention. You may require prescription medication depending on the cause of the illness, and in severe cases admission for intravenous fluids and close monitoring. The healthcare provider may conduct stool tests to identify the causative organism. Please go to your nearest clinic or hospital as soon as possible."
