    "203": " Hello, I am a neurologist on ChatDoctor. The report you have provided is of a carotid ultrasound. It assesses the blood flow in the carotid arteries located in the neck which supply blood to the brain. The first thing noted in the report is that the pulse waves are regular and there is no abnormal rhythm, which is a good finding. The next part of the report describes the velocities of the blood flow in different areas of the carotid arteries. PS/ED Velocity stands for Peak Systolic/End Diastolic Velocity, which represents the maximum and minimum velocities of blood flow in the arteries during systole (when the heart contracts) and diastole (when the heart relaxes). Distal CCA, ICA, and ECA stand for Common Carotid Artery, Internal Carotid Artery, and External Carotid Artery respectively. These are the different parts of the carotid artery and the velocities are measured in each segment. The ICA/CCA ratio is calculated by dividing the Internal Carotid Artery velocity by the Common Carotid Artery velocity. This ratio helps assess the severity of any narrowing or blockage in the carotid artery. Lastly, vertebral-antegrade flow refers to the direction of the blood flow in the vertebral artery, which is another artery that supplies blood to the brain.

Cannabis when inhaled or smoked contains a chemical known as delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol or simply THC that acts specifically on Central Nervous system. The different components of the body are influenced differently by this chemical. It can act on brain, which is responsible for the Spasm, on the receptors of stomach, responsible for the diarrhoea, the eyes which caused the tunnel vision and the heart which caused the rapid heartbeat. The THC also causes rapid breathing with withdrawal of blood from the periphery to the core of the body increasing the body temperature to as high as 109 degrees Farenheit. But the beauty of the body lies in it's ability to adapt to the environment and that adaptation to the chemical now causes your pain located in the back and also reduces the night vision with slowing of the heartbeat also. I think and strongly opine that the whole of the body is being affected. Nothing to be scared of. I would definitely suggest slowing down on the Caffeine part of the diet too. Phenylethylamine also causes rapid heart beat. Caffeine can continuously stimulate the CNS. Cannabis which inactivates CNS can cause checkpoint inhibition i.e. the Caffeine does not inactivates the CNS but caffeine is not enough to cause the activation. So the disease is not progressing.

    "455": "Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Fever is your body's way of fighting infection. In most cases, the body can fight the infection on its own and raise its temperature to kill off the bacteria or virus infecting you. There is no definite pathogenesis but increase in body temperature is caused by the release of mediators like prostaglandins which acts on hypothalamus. As core temperature still remains normal fever is compensated by vasoconstriction and muscle shivering. Once core temperature rises above normal threshold shivering and vasoconstriction are compensated by methods to release heat. These include sweating, vasodilatation and conductive heat loss increase. So it is normal to have high grade fever on day 1 and 2 and then low grade on 3-4-5th days, called step ladder. Follow measures to decrease fever, which include; you can place a bath towel soaked with tap water over the skin caused by infection to help lower the fever. Drink plenty of water to keep you hydrated. Take lots of rest to help fight the infection and to bring your body temperature down. Usually it takes 7-10 days to come back to normal. If temperature rises again getting up to 50 C than you might require some antipyretic. Regards",

    "587": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern about the blood in your urine. It is good that you have already consulted a medical professional and underwent some tests. With your age and relatively good health, it is unlikely that the blood in your urine is related to kidney disease. The normal creatinine level and GFR also support this.

    "588": "HelloThank you for writing to us. I understand your concerns and I am here to help. Firstly, let me assure you that having a scar after circumcision is completely normal and does not affect the function or appearance of the penis. The stretch marks on the scar tissue could be due to the stretching of the skin during erection. As for the asymmetry and slope, it is possible that during the procedure, the skin was pulled more to one side or the incision was made slightly uneven. Unfortunately, there are no ointments or creams that can completely fade scars or even out the coloration of the scar tissue. However, you can try using silicone-based scar gels or sheets, which have been proven to help with scar appearance. It is important to massage the scar tissue regularly to help with skin elasticity and promote healing. As for the dehydration, I would recommend using a good moisturizing lotion to keep the skin hydrated. If you have any further concerns, I recommend consulting with a cosmetic surgeon who may be able to offer other options to improve the appearance of the scar. I hope this helps. Take care.",

    "801": " Hello, and thank you for reaching out. I can understand your concern and frustration with the situation. The bleeding on August 15th was most likely due to the emergency contraceptive pill, also known as withdrawal bleeding, as it usually occurs within a few days after taking the pill. It is unlikely to be ovulation bleeding or implantation bleeding.  As for your next period, it is difficult to predict the exact date, but I would say it is likely to be around September 2nd-3rd, as usual for your regular cycle. However, if it is significantly delayed or does not come at all, you should take a pregnancy test to rule out any possibility of pregnancy. While the chances of pregnancy are low with the use of emergency contraceptives, they are still not 100% effective and the best way to ensure no unwanted pregnancy is to use proper protection, such as a dual condom or another form of birth control. I hope this information helps and wish you the best of luck in your future sexual experiences. Take care.",

    "811": "Hello, Thank you for your question. Based on the scenario you described, the chances of pregnancy are very low. Precum itself does not usually contain a significant amount of sperm, and even if it did, the sperm would need to enter your vagina for there to be a chance of pregnancy. In this case, you did not have direct genital contact and did not engage in penetrative sex, plus the sperm would have been exposed to air for a significant amount of time, making it less likely to survive. Additionally, if you did not wash your hands before urinating, it is highly unlikely that any sperm would have been transferred to your vagina. However, if you are concerned about pregnancy, you can take a pregnancy test to be sure. It is always best to practice safe sex and use contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancy.

In an inhaled form (such as nasal spray or inhalers), corticosteroids are used as controller medicines to control asthma symptoms. You have mentioned drying out as a symptom, the drying of which is usually seen with over-use of oral steroids or inhaled steroids. There is a very wide gap in the effects of oral and inhaled steroids. So far I am advocating intranasal corticosteroids is for your relief for controlling of your symptoms than taking course of oral steroids. Accordingly you have to consult at an Allergist-Immunologist in your area.2. In case, allergy testing would identify for the substances you are allergic to, allergen specific immunotherapy can also relieve your allergy and your bronchial symptoms. Both - intranasal and sublingual immunotherapies have shown great results in effectively treating those suffering from rhinitis and bronchial allergies. Hope this will be helpful to you.

If another deplete suddenly & AMH is < 0.3 ng/ml, please do not waste your time & money in trying more. Better opt for egg DONOR program. Have a good future discussion with your IVF clinic.

    "827": "Hello, Thanks for your query at Chat Doctor. Most common cause for increased SGOT is fatty liver. It is associated with diabetes, insulin resistance and obe...se. You should avoid alcohol, smoking, oily & fatty food, reduce weight & do exercise. Take medication if your doctor has advised you.

This can cause severe pain, and if the reduced blood flow is due to a blood clot sticking to a plaque in a coronary artery you can suffer a massive heart attack. Physical exertion may cause the inadequate supply of blood to the heart, but the pain generally goes away after a few minutes rest because your heart can help recover some oxygen from compressed heart muscle as it exchanging nutrients. You have mentioned pain and burning sensation in chest bone along with the thoracic vertebral column. I think doctors can be correct as the burning pain might be referred from your heart.

    "1223": "Hello dear, In your present situation the chances of pregnancy are very less because you have only missed one pill. Also, you have taken it the next day when you remembered. If you are taking the pills as per the schedule there is always a less chance of pregnancy. But, in case of any doubts, you may do an urine test with the kit available in the market. Also, it is advised to continue the pills and for the current pack use other contraceptive methods along with it. Use a condom for the next seven days after the missed pill to prevent pregnancy. If you have missed the dose of a combined oral contraceptive pill with no progestogen complaints, one can take the pill (if you remember within 12 hours of the missed pill). If you missed any dose of a combined oral contraceptive pill with progestogens, or any pill with desogestrel or gestodene in it or any progestin-only pill is missed for up to 3 hours, consider this as a missed pill. Any missed pill either combined or progestin-only pill with or without progestogens or non-progestogens can be taken as soon as she remembers. But on consecutive days, double the dose and continue as usual until the end of cycle. This should be followed irrespective of missed pill(s) even if you are in your fertile period. Hope that helps.

Henceforth, you can get a trans-vaginal ultrasound in the sixth week of pregnancy to see for any evidence of gestational sac or cardiac activity as per protocol.

    "1370": "Dear Judith,Thank you for trusting me on Chat Doctor. I have gone through the elaborate history of the patient. Firstly, since the patient had a heart attack in the past, it is very important to rule out any recurrent cardiac event. Even though the current symptoms may not be the typical presentation, it is better to be cautious and seek medical attention. A 12 lead ECG and cardiac enzymes should be done to rule out any cardiac related issues. Other possible causes of chest pain could be musculoskeletal pain due to possible underlying arthritis or infection in the chest area. An xray of the chest can help diagnose any infection or inflammation. If the patient has allergies to dye, a non-contrast MRI can be done to investigate further. I am glad to hear that acupuncture and herbal remedies have been helpful, but it is still important to follow up with conventional medical care. I hope this helps. Take care.",

As a doctor, I highly recommend that you consult with your primary healthcare provider for the best and most personalized advice for your specific situation. In general, when starting a new oral contraceptive pill, it is recommended to take the first pill on the first day of your period. However, if you do not have a current period, you can start taking the pill on any day. It is important to use a backup method of contraception, such as condoms, for the first 7 days of taking the pill to ensure maximum effectiveness. Your healthcare provider can also provide more information on the best way to transition from the contraceptive injection to the oral contraceptive. Take care and good luck with your contraception plan!",

Your last period dates suggest that you should be further along, but again, this is just an estimation and can vary. The best way to confirm the conception date would be to have a paternity test done once the baby is born. I hope this helps. Best wishes. ",
    "1373": "I apologize, but as a doctor, it is not appropriate for me to diagnose a medical condition without personally examining a patient and conducting the necessary tests.

    "1587": "Hello, Thank you for your inquiry. I will address each of your questions separately. 1. Taking emergency contraceptive pills like i-pill or unwanted once a month can have adverse effects on your menstrual cycle such as irregular bleeding, spotting, and changes in flow and duration of your period. It may also lead to hormone imbalances and affect your fertility in the long run. These pills should not be taken regularly and should only be used in emergency situations. 2. The flow of your periods does matter in terms of future pregnancy. A shorter and lighter period may indicate a hormonal imbalance or an underlying condition such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). It is important to consult with a gynecologist to rule out any potential issues that may affect your fertility. 3. Taking an i-pill in such a short time difference is generally considered safe, but it should not be used as a regular method of contraception. These pills are meant for emergency situations only and taking them frequently can have negative effects on your health. They can also cause hormonal imbalances and affect your fertility in the long run. It is best to use a regular method of contraception and only use emergency contraceptive pills as a last resort. I hope this answers your questions. Please consult with your gynecologist for further guidance. Take care.",

    "1592": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. I am pleased to answer your question. Your lab tests seem alright except for a low TSH level. If I was your treating doctor then I would request to lower down the dose of levothyroxine because a supratherapeutic dose is known to induce this syndrome. You may also experience palpitations if you have some underlying heart disease which was triggered by excessive thyroid hormone. Moreover, you must be knowing that since thyroid hormones increase blood flow to various parts of the body including heart, lungs, muscles,and the central nervous system, disrupting the normal balance may lead to sustained feeling of anxiety, heart palpitations, headaches, and other uncomfortable sensations. Sometimes antiarrhythmic drugs because of their proarrhythmic action may worsen benign palpitations, therefore I do not recommend its use. If you are determined to continue your medication then you may discuss with your treating doctor about prescribing ECG monitor or 24 to 48 hours heart monitoring at home so that a baseline comparison can be made. Do not stop taking levothyroxine without your treating doctor's consent. Hope I have answered your query. Wish you good luck and good health.",

    "1620": "Hello,Thank you for your query. I understand your concern. Pregnancy can be a big decision and can bring a lot of unknowns. Some women have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, and some women do not. Vaginal bleeding is relatively common during pregnancy with approximately 20% of women experiencing it. Generally though, it is considered normal and does not need treatment or investigation. This bleeding may be due to the fertilized egg dividing and growing into a blastocyst which implants in the lining of your uterus on about day 6 after fertilization. This blastocyst starts to produce hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) which is the pregnancy hormone. It takes 2-3 days after implantation for this hormone to be made and by then it may be found in your urine, and on a pregnancy test. If your pregnancy test is negative and there is no other reason besides pregnancy which is causing you to miss a period, then your doctor could have a ChatDoctor taken if you have not started your period within a week of the negative test I hope this helps.

In this condition, the pelvic floor muscles become weak and unable to support the organs in the abdomen, causing a sensation of pressure or heaviness in the vaginal and anal area. The jolting sensation could be a result of these muscles trying to contract to compensate for the weakness. The fact that it happens while sitting and standing also points to this diagnosis. I would suggest consulting a pelvic floor physical therapist for specific exercises to strengthen these muscles. Also, make sure to stay hydrated and treat any underlying infections promptly to prevent recurrence. I hope this helps. Take care. Regards, Chat Doctor.",
    "1902": " Hello, Thank you for your question. Copper T is a very effective form of birth control and is 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. However, like any medical procedure, there are some risks involved. Some women may experience heavier periods and cramping after having the Copper T inserted, while others may not have any change in their menstrual cycle. Weight gain is not a common side effect, but it can happen in some women. It should not affect your breastfeeding, but it is always recommended to consult with your doctor before making any changes to your birth control while breastfeeding. There are other forms of birth control available after childbirth, such as the hormonal IUD, the contraceptive implant, and different types of contraceptive pills. The adjustment period for Copper T varies for each woman, but it can take up to 6 months for your body to adjust. I hope this helps. Best of luck to you. ",

The combination of the condom breaking and taking the Plan B pill twice within 24 hours does increase the effectiveness of the pill in preventing pregnancy.

Based on your description she may be suffering from reactive airways disease which is an infection causing inflammation in the air passages. Human body has its own natural defense mechanism. Whenever dust, dirt, smoke, pollen, wool, certain food stuffs or toners inhales these foreign materials, the body will respond to them by producing IgE antibodies in response. The IgE antibodies tell certain cells in the body, called mast cells, to release chemicals into the bloodstream, one of which is histamine that is responsible for the inflammation and cause of cough. Fever and high white blood cells can also get due to raised levels of IgE. This doesn't necessarily mean he has pneumonia. The ongoing lung congestion could be due to pulmonary fibrosis secondary to asthmatic bronchitis and if that was the case she should be on a preventative medication such as a prescribed steroid inhaler. Normal treatment of such a would be to prescribe a bronchodilator such as Ventolin for use as needed or a nebulizer, mucolytic drugs (to thin the increasing mucus), and to prescribe anti histamine in this case.

Additionally, every individual's cancer is unique and may require a specific treatment plan. Starving the cancer cells of food may also not be effective as they can adapt to different environments and can still survive.

    "2698": " Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Nodulocalcific granuloma means a small nodule (less than 3 cm) in your lung with calcification inside. It is suggestive of old, healed infection (mostly tuberculosis) in your lung. So you must have had some infection in your lung in the past and now it is healed with residual scar and calcification. It is not a major concern as it is completely healed. But as you are planning to work in GCC countries, it may cause some problem. So consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test). If PFT is normal then medication can be given to you to suppress cough and reduce phlegm production. Surgery is not needed in majority of the cases. So don't worry and get done PFT first. If PFT is abnormal then combination therapy can be given to you (inhaled bronchodilator and low dose inhaled corticosteroid). Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

    "2937": "Hello dear, thanks for reaching out to Chat Doctor. I understand your concerns regarding precum and its relation to pregnancy. Precum, also known as pre-ejaculate, is a clear fluid that is secreted from the Cowper's gland in the male reproductive system. This gland is located near the urethra and secretes a fluid that helps protect the sperm as they pass through the urethra. However, precum does not initially contain any sperm. There may be some leftover sperm in the urethra from a previous ejaculation, but it is not typically enough to cause pregnancy. To answer your question about urine, it does not kill sperm, but it may wash out any remaining sperm in the urethra. It is also important to note that precum itself does not contain any sperm, it may pick up some sperm if there is any remaining in the urethra from a previous ejaculation. As for the likelihood of pregnancy, it is generally considered to be a low risk as long as the precum does not enter the vagina. However, if there is any concern, it is always best to take a pregnancy test or consult with a healthcare professional. I hope this helps to clarify things for you. Take care.",

    "2971": "Hello Ms Katarina, Thank you for writing to Chat Doctor. Severe psoriasis (>20% body area involvement with scaling/ plaques) do benefit with phototherapy (is a type of ultraviolet light therapy). A word of caution - scalp psoriasis may not respond adequately to phototherapy. Topical treatment with vitamin D analogues (calcitriol/calcipotriol) or corticosteroids alone is usually not sufficient for severe psoriasis. Topical treatment is usually combined with oral treatment (acretin/ methotrexate etc). Please note that photosensitive drugs like acretin and methotrexate should not be taken with phototherapy. Enbrel is the brand name for 'etanercept' (a biologic drug) and it does not affect phototherapy. Phototherapy is a long term treatment and you must make sure the treating doctor follows up regularly to detect or prevent any side effects or drug interactions. I am sorry that I was not able to comment on horse milk, can you please repeat the question with perhaps by providing the ingredient/ brand name. A simple rule every patient should follow while treating psoriasis is - the more severe the disease the more aggressive the treatment should be. Your nephew has lots of treatment options from topical treatment, oral treatment to injectable biologics but the right choice of treatment depends on his general health, disease severity, psoriasis lesions characteristics and probably patient preferences too.

    "2979": "Hi,Welcome to Ask a Doctor service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The treatment of recurrent neck nodes from head and neck cancer should be based on the first treatment, site of recurrence and location of neck node recurrence alone. If recurrence occurs within short time interval, then systemic chemotherapy followed by neck dissection would be reasonable option, whereas if there was longer interval between treatment of first and second recurrence which may mean disease free interval is longer and disease response may have been better, hence radical neck dissection will be needed. The percentage of five-year survival rate for stage II squamous cell carcinoma (spread in upper neck lymph nodes only) not associated with HPV is only estimated at 70%.
