    "32": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. COPD is a chronic inflammatory disease of lungs. COPD is diagnosed by Pulmonary Function Test (PFT). In this test, we measure how much air you can inhale and exhale in one breath and how quickly the air is moved out of your lungs. PFT can rule out possibility of COPD. Treatment of COPD depends on severity of the disease. If you have mild COPD, bronchodilators are the only medications you may need. Bronchodilators are inhalers that open (dilate) the airways in your lungs to help you breathe better. If you have moderate or severe COPD, in addition to bronchodilators, your doctor may prescribe inhaled corticosteroids. These are steroids that go directly to your lungs to help reduce inflammation. They do not work as quickly as bronchodilators, so they are used for long-term management of COPD symptoms. They are not used for quick relief of symptoms. You will take inhaled corticosteroids every day to help prevent flare-ups. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.",

    "44": "Hello, Thanks for writing to us. Neurocysticercosis is caused by the larval form of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, and is acquired by ingestion of tapeworm eggs from contaminated food or water or, less commonly, by autoinfection. Neurocysticercosis is treatable and curable if diagnosed and treated early. The treatment of Neurocysticercosis depends on the location of the cyst, the severity of symptoms, and whether the cyst is active or calcified. In general, anti-inflammatory medications and anticonvulsants are used to treat the symptoms of Neurocysticercosis. Surgery may be necessary to remove cysts from the brain or spinal cord in some cases. Regarding your question about whether Neurocysticercosis could continue in your family, it is possible but not necessarily likely. If your wife and daughter have been treated and have no further exposure to contaminated food or water, the risk of them passing the infection to others in the family is low. However, it is always important to practice good hygiene and food handling techniques to prevent the spread of any infections. I hope this information is helpful.

While there is currently no cure for these conditions, treatment can help manage symptoms and improve your brothers quality of life. Medications are often an important part of treatment, but they are not a cure-all. It may take some time to find the right combination of medications that work best for your brother.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help your brother learn coping strategies to manage his symptoms and improve his quality of life. When your brother becomes agitated, it can be helpful to have a de-escalation plan in place. This plan should include strategies to help him calm down and relax, such as deep breathing exercises, listening to music, or taking a walk. It may also be helpful to identify triggers that lead to agitation and avoid them if possible. Finally, it is important to remember that caring for a loved one with childhood schizophrenia and autism can be challenging.

However, paracentesis can sometimes cause side effects like dehydration and disorientation, as your father experienced.

    "91": "Hi, Thanks for writing to us. The bumps around your bakini area could be due to ingrown hair or razor bumps. Ingrown hair is a common problem, especially in people with curly hair. When you shave, the hair is cut at an angle, and the sharp end of the hair can pierce the skin and grow back into it. This can cause a bump or an infection. Razor bumps are caused by irritation from shaving. They can be prevented by using a sharp razor, shaving in the direction of hair growth, and using a shaving cream or gel. The dark spots could be due to hyperpigmentation, which is caused by inflammation or irritation of the skin. This can happen when you shave or wax, and the hair follicles become inflamed. To get rid of the bumps and dark spots, you can try the following:  1. Exfoliate regularly: Use a gentle exfoliator to remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. This will help prevent ingrown hairs and razor bumps. 2. Use a medicated cream: Apply a cream containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to the bumps. This will help reduce inflammation and unclog pores. 3. Use a razor with multiple blades: A razor with multiple blades will cut the hair more evenly and reduce the risk of ingrown hairs. 4. Shave in the direction of hair growth: Shaving against the direction of hair growth can cause ingrown hairs and razor bumps. 5. Avoid tight clothing: Tight clothing can irritate the skin and cause ingrown hairs and razor bumps. Wear loose-fitting clothes made of breathable fabrics.  If these methods do not work, you may need to see a dermatologist for further treatment. However, if you are concerned about the cost, you can try visiting a community health center or a clinic that offers sliding scale fees based on your income.",

    "93": "Hello, Aluminum crowns are used in both primary (baby) and permanent teeth. However, they are most commonly used in primary teeth because they are less expensive and easier to place than stainless steel crowns. In permanent teeth, aluminum crowns are typically used as a temporary restoration until a more permanent solution can be placed. The use of aluminum crowns in permanent teeth is generally limited to teeth that are not visible when smiling, such as back teeth, because they are not as strong or aesthetically pleasing as other crown materials. The American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) both have position statements on the use of aluminum crowns in dentistry. These statements can be found on their respective websites. Additionally, you may be able to find information on the use of aluminum crowns in dental textbooks or scientific journals.

    "103": "Hello and thanks for trusting me with your health care concern. The bumps on your son's butt could be due to various reasons. The most common cause is bacterial or fungal infection. These infections are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans, which are normally present on the skin and in the intestines. When the skin becomes damaged or irritated, these bacteria or fungi can cause an infection. The bumps may also be caused by an allergic reaction to something that your son has come into contact with, such as a new type of diaper, soap, or laundry detergent. The bumps could also be caused by a viral infection, such as molluscum contagiosum, which is a common skin infection in children. It is important not to pop or squeeze the bumps as this can cause further irritation and increase the risk of infection. If you think that your son's bumps may be caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, you should take him to see a doctor. The doctor may prescribe antibiotics or antifungal medication to clear up the infection. If the bumps are caused by an allergic reaction, the doctor may recommend avoiding the allergen and using a topical cream or ointment to soothe the skin. If the bumps are caused by a viral infection, they may clear up on their own without treatment. However, if the bumps are painful or persistent, you should still take your son to see a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.",

Based on what you've described, it sounds like you had an x-ray of your chest that showed some changes to the shape of your heart and aorta. \"Left ventricular configuration\" refers to the shape of the left ventricle, which is one of the four chambers in your heart. This chamber is responsible for pumping blood out to the rest of your body. \"Mild unfolding of the aorta\" means that the aorta, which is the main blood vessel that carries blood away from your heart, appears to be slightly enlarged or dilated. This can sometimes be a normal finding, especially as we age, but it can also be a sign of an underlying problem such as high blood pressure or a valve problem in the heart. It's important to follow up with your doctor to further investigate these findings and determine if any additional testing or treatment is needed. I hope this helps and wish you the best of luck.",

    "134": "Hello! I would be glad to assist you with your medical questions.Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a protein produced only by thyroid cells and thyroid cancer cells. After total thyroidectomy and RAI therapy, Tg levels should be very low or undetectable (<1 ng/mL). However, in some cases, Tg antibodies (TgAb) can interfere with the Tg test, causing falsely high or falsely low Tg levels.TgAb is an immune system response to Tg protein, which can occur in some people after total thyroidectomy and RAI therapy. TgAb can bind to Tg protein and prevent it from being cleared from the blood, leading to falsely high Tg levels. On the other hand, TgAb can also bind to the Tg test and prevent it from detecting Tg protein, leading to falsely low Tg levels.In your case, your Tg levels are slightly elevated at 0.1 and 2.2 ng/mL, and your TgAb levels are also elevated at 23.3 and 24.3 IU/mL. This suggests that your Tg levels may be affected by TgAb interference, making it difficult to interpret your Tg results.It is important to note that elevated Tg levels alone do not necessarily indicate persistent/recurrent cancer. Other factors such as the presence of thyroid remnants or benign thyroid nodules can also cause elevated Tg levels.To further evaluate your condition, your doctor may recommend additional tests such as neck ultrasound, CT scan, or PET scan to look for any evidence of persistent/recurrent cancer. Additionally, your doctor may also consider repeating your Tg test with a different method that is less affected by TgAb interference.I hope this information helps you understand your test results better. Please feel free to ask any further questions or concerns you may have.",

    "137": "Hello, Congratulations on your pregnancy. You are 40 weeks pregnant and it appears that you are experiencing some prenatal discharge. The clear stringy discharge you are noticing in your urine could be due to the increase in cervical mucus production. As your body prepares for labor, the cervix begins to ripen and efface, which can cause an increase in mucus production. This mucus can be thin and stringy, and it may contain small amounts of blood or other fluids. The slightly sticky discharge you are noticing in your underwear could be due to the leakage of amniotic fluid. As your pregnancy progresses, the amniotic sac that surrounds your baby can rupture, causing a small leak or gush of fluid. This is known as amniotic fluid leakage and it can be a sign of preterm labor. However, it can also occur in normal pregnancies as the baby's head presses down on the cervix, causing small amounts of fluid to leak out. It is important to contact your healthcare provider if you experience any leakage of amniotic fluid or if you have any concerns about your prenatal discharge. They can help determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatment if necessary.",

    "193": "Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. Coffee is a drink that we prepare from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. It is the most widely consumed psychoactive drink in the world, and can have stimulant effects in humans due to its caffeine content. Coffee consumption is associated with a lower overall risk of death, and it has been suggested that this may be due to its effects on insulin sensitivity and inflammation. However, drinking coffee excessively or in large amounts may cause some side effects such as insomnia, nervousness, restlessness, irritability, stomach upset, fast heartbeat and muscle tremors. Caffeine is also known to act as a diuretic, which means that it can increase urine output and cause dehydration. In your case, you have had multiple intestinal surgeries, and your wellness physician has advised you to stop all caffeine intake due to the risk of leaky intestines. Leaky gut syndrome, also known as increased intestinal permeability, is a proposed condition in which the lining of the intestines becomes damaged, leading to a leaky gut. This can allow bacteria, toxins, and undigested food particles to pass through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, leading to inflammation and a range of health problems. Given your history of intestinal surgeries and blockages, it is understandable that your physician would recommend avoiding caffeine, as it could potentially exacerbate any existing intestinal issues. However, if you love coffee and are looking for an alternative, you may consider trying a low-acid coffee or a decaffeinated coffee. There are also some specialty coffee brands that are specifically marketed as being easier on the digestive system, such as those that are certified organic and/or fair trade. Ultimately, the decision to consume coffee or any other caffeinated beverage should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider, who can advise you based on your individual health status and medical history.",

It acts in a similar way to opiates by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and nervous system to block pain signals. However, because tramadol is a synthetic opioid and not derived from the opium poppy, it is not technically classified as an opiate.

I would advise you to get an ultrasound of your kidneys done to confirm the diagnosis. You should continue taking the antibiotics as advised by your doctor and also take painkillers to help you with the pain. You should also drink plenty of water to flush out the infection. I hope this helps you. If you have any further queries, please feel free to ask me.",

    "207": "Hello! I am glad to hear that you are feeling better after starting Montek LC. Montek LC is a combination medication containing two active ingredients: levocetirizine and montelukast.

    "208": "Hello, thanks for providing details about your daughter's condition after the wisdom teeth removal. The bruising and swelling that your daughter experienced after the surgery can be attributed to the surgical trauma, which can cause blood vessels to leak and lead to bruising. The hard lump that has formed could be a result of the stitches that were placed to close the wound. As the tissues heal, they may form scar tissue or adhesions, which can feel hard to the touch. It is not uncommon for patients to experience some bruising and swelling after wisdom teeth removal, but the extent of the bruising and swelling can vary depending on the individual. If your daughter is concerned about the appearance of the bruising or if the hard lump persists, she should follow up with her oral surgeon or dentist for further evaluation.",

    "210": "Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. Root canal treatment is done to save an infected tooth. During the treatment, the dentist removes the infected pulp and cleans the inside of the tooth, then fills and seals it. Sometimes, even after starting the treatment, there can be some residual infection present which can cause symptoms like fever, swelling, or pain. In such cases, your dentist may prescribe antibiotics to clear the infection. It is important to complete the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed by your dentist. If the infection clears up and the tooth is healthy, it is usually possible to continue with the root canal treatment and save the tooth. However, if the infection does not clear up or if the tooth is not healthy, your dentist may recommend removing the tooth. It is best to discuss your options with your dentist and follow their recommendations for your specific case.",
    "211": "Short answer: Yes, surgery for varicose veins can be done immediately. Stones can be treated with medication or procedures depending on their size and location. Detailed answer: Thank you for writing to Chat Doctor.com. I have gone through your case and understand your concern. The pain you are experiencing in your pelvis area could be due to various reasons. The diagnosis of mild varicose veins near your left testicle and the presence of stones in your right kidney could both be contributing factors. Regarding the varicose veins, if the symptoms are severe, then surgery can be considered as a treatment option. However, it is always advisable to explore non-surgical options first, such as wearing compression stockings or undergoing endovenous laser treatment. You may discuss these options with your urologist. As for the kidney stones, the treatment approach depends on the size and location of the stones. If the stones are small (less than 5mm), they may pass spontaneously with increased fluid intake and medication to help relax the ureters. If the stones are larger, then procedures such as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) or ureteroscopy may be required to break up and remove the stones. It is important to follow up with your urologist and internal medicine doctor to determine the best course of treatment for your specific case. I hope this information helps.

    "233": "Hello, thanks for trusting the Chat Doctor doctors for your health related queries. Well, facial hair problems in females can be due to various reasons like hormonal imbalance, heredity, or due to some medications like steroids. As you mentioned that you have been detected with PCOS, it can be one of the reasons for your facial hair problem. PCOS stands for polycystic ovary syndrome. It is a common problem in which a woman's hormones are out of balance. This can lead to problems with menstrual periods, weight, and even fertility. PCOS is a lifelong condition, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and prevent long-term health problems. Coming to your treatment, Ginette 35 tablets contain a combination of 2 hormones, ethinylestradiol and cyproterone acetate. Ethinylestradiol is a synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen, and cyproterone acetate is a synthetic form of the male hormone progesterone. This combination of hormones helps to regulate your menstrual cycle and reduce the production of androgens (male hormones) in your body. This can help to reduce facial hair growth. Uproot lotion contains eflornithine which helps to slow down the growth of facial hair. It can be used in combination with other treatments like waxing, threading or tweezing to manage facial hair. The effectiveness of these treatments depends on various factors like the severity of your condition, response to treatment, and adherence to treatment. It is difficult to predict how much time it will take to show results as it varies from person to person. I would suggest you give these treatments a trial for at least 3-4 months and see if there is any improvement. If there is no improvement, you can consult your doctor for alternative treatments like laser hair removal or electrolysis. Regards.",

    "255": "Hello, Thanks for writing to us. Hepatitis A is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation and disease. The bilirubin count is a measure of how well the liver is functioning, and a high count can indicate liver damage or disease. Scratching all over the body can be a symptom of itching, which is a common symptom of liver disease. An MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography) is an imaging test that can help diagnose problems with the bile ducts, pancreas, and liver. If the MRCP results are normal, it suggests that there are no blockages or structural abnormalities in these organs. However, endoscopy is a diagnostic procedure that uses a thin, flexible tube with a camera and light on the end to examine the inside of the body. In this case, an endoscopy may be suggested to further investigate the cause of your brother's high bilirubin count and liver disease. It would be best to follow the advice of your brother's doctors and have the endoscopy done as soon as possible to aid in his diagnosis and treatment plan. I hope this information helps.

Hyper arousal is a state of persistent, excessive alertness following a period of stress or anxiety. It is a common symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but it can also occur in other anxiety disorders. There are several treatment options available for hyper arousal. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for hyper arousal. It helps you to identify and change the thought patterns and behaviors that are contributing to your symptoms. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is another effective treatment for hyper arousal. It involves learning to pay attention to the present moment without judgment, which can help to reduce stress and anxiety. Medications such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs may also be prescribed to help manage hyper arousal symptoms. However, these should be used under the guidance of a mental health professional.

Until you see the endocrinologist, there are a few things you can do to help manage your symptoms and prepare for treatment. First, try to keep a positive attitude and reduce stress as much as possible. This can help support your immune system and overall health.

These can include irregular periods, heavier periods, and cramping. However, it is also possible that you may be pregnant, as the IUD is not 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. I would recommend taking another pregnancy test, as sometimes it can be too early to detect a pregnancy with a test.

    "360": "Hi, Thanks for writing to us. I have read your query in detail. The testosterone levels can rise due to various reasons. One of the most common causes is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may have higher levels of testosterone than normal, which can cause various symptoms such as infertility, irregular periods, acne, hair loss, and hirsutism (excessive hair growth). Diane-35 is a combination of two hormonal medications, cyproterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol. Cyproterone acetate is an anti-androgen that blocks the effects of testosterone in the body, while ethinyl estradiol is an estrogen that helps regulate the menstrual cycle. Diane-35 is commonly used to treat symptoms of PCOS, such as hirsutism and acne. However, in some cases, Diane-35 may not be effective in lowering testosterone levels, and they may even increase in some women. This could be due to various reasons such as the dosage of the medication, duration of treatment, or individual response to the medication. If you are planning to conceive, I would suggest you discuss your options with your gynecologist. Your doctor may advise you to try other medications or treatment options to lower your testosterone levels and improve your fertility. Pregnyl is a hormonal medication that is commonly used to induce ovulation in women who are not ovulating regularly. If your doctor advises you to take Pregnyl, they will monitor your response to the medication and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.",

It is possible that the combination of alcohol and Effexor could have contributed to the rapid decompensation you observed in your friend. Given your friend's history of alcoholism and his recent behavior, it is important that he receives proper medical attention and care. It is concerning that his Nurse Practitioner did not take his alcohol consumption seriously and even encouraged him to decrease his consumption without addressing the underlying issues. It is important that your friend sees a physician who is trained in addiction medicine and who can provide him with the appropriate treatment and support. An emergency assessment in the ED may be necessary if your friend experiences similar episodes in the future, as his behavior could be potentially dangerous.

However, the amount of THC that reaches the baby is dependent on many factors, such as the timing and frequency of use, as well as the baby's own metabolism. Quitting smoking, drinking alcohol and eating healthy are positive steps you have taken to promote a healthy pregnancy. I would recommend that you continue to avoid marijuana use and other substances during pregnancy and while caring for your baby.

    "544": "Hi, Acoustic neuromas are benign tumors of the nerve that supplies hearing and balance to the inner ear. They are also known as vestibular schwannomas. These tumors can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance problems. The treatment for acoustic neuromas depends on the size of the tumor and the severity of the symptoms. Observation and regular monitoring with MRI scans are often recommended for small tumors that are not causing symptoms. Radiation therapy can also be used to slow the growth of the tumor. Surgical removal of the tumor is usually recommended for larger tumors or tumors that are causing severe symptoms. In your case, it seems that you had lazer treatment in 2002 and you have been fine until this year. Your recent fall and the associated symptoms of dizziness suggest that there may be a recurrence of the tumor or some other problem affecting your balance system. Meclizine is an antihistamine medication that is commonly used to treat symptoms of vertigo, dizziness, and nausea. It can be effective in reducing symptoms of dizziness caused by inner ear problems, but it does not treat the underlying condition.

Your physician may prescribe pain medications and/or muscle relaxants to help alleviate your symptoms. Physical therapy may include exercises to stretch and strengthen your lower back and leg muscles, as well as modalities such as heat or cold therapy, electrical stimulation, and massage to help reduce pain and inflammation.\n\nIn addition to these treatments, your physician may recommend lifestyle modifications such as losing weight, avoiding smoking, and improving your posture and ergonomics to help prevent further aggravation of your condition.\n\nIf your symptoms persist or worsen despite these treatments, your physician may consider more invasive options such as spinal injections or surgery.

If you have any concerns or if the lump does not seem to be improving, I would recommend following up with your doctor for further evaluation.",
    "554": "Hello, I can understand your concern. Based on the symptoms you described, it sounds like you might have developed a viral infection, possibly herpes simplex virus (HSV), which causes cold sores or fever blisters. These sores can appear on the lips, tongue, inside the mouth, and even on the tonsils. The white bumps on the side of your tongue could be enlarged taste buds or possibly a result of inflammation from the viral infection. It's important for you to visit your doctor tomorrow for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They may recommend antiviral medication to help clear up the infection and ease your symptoms. In the meantime, try to avoid eating spicy or acidic foods as they can irritate the sores and cause more pain. I hope this information helps and I wish you a speedy recovery.",
    "555": "Hello, I can understand your concern. Loss of movement can be due to various reasons like swelling, pain, infection, tendon overuse, or adhesions. To differentiate between tendon overuse and infection, you should look for signs of inflammation (redness, warmth, swelling, and pain) and fever. If you have any of these signs, it could be an infection and you should seek medical attention immediately. If there is no sign of infection, then it could be due to tendon overuse or adhesions. Adhesions are bands of scar tissue that can form after surgery and limit movement. Your doctor can help you determine the cause of your loss of movement and recommend appropriate treatment. Thank you for consulting me.",
    "556": "These kind of pain are not unusual after any intra abdominal surgeries including appendectomy. The pain is due to the pull of the sutures, which are placed deep in the layers of the abdominal wall and also due to surgical trauma to the muscles of the abdominal wall. It increases on movement or coughing due to the increased tension in the abdominal wall muscles. It will settle down in next few days as your body gets used to the sutures and healing takes place. You may take simple pain killers like paracetamol or ibuprofen for the pain. If pain is severe or increasing then you should see your surgeon.",

    "559": "Hello, thanks for reaching out. I understand your concern regarding your swollen lymph nodes and other symptoms. While it is true that allergies and sinus infections can cause swollen lymph nodes, it is also important to investigate other possible causes, especially if the symptoms persist for a long time. Constant poking at the lymph nodes can also cause irritation and tenderness. I would advise you to avoid poking at them and see if the tenderness subsides. Additionally, I would recommend that you get a thorough examination by a specialist such as an otolaryngologist (ENT specialist) to rule out any other possible causes of your symptoms. They may order imaging studies or biopsies to get a better understanding of what is causing your lymph nodes to be swollen. In the meantime, try to manage your anxiety by practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or yoga. I hope this helps and wish you a speedy recovery.",

    "564": "Hello, thanks for contacting Chat Doctor. I am an internal medicine specialist. Your baby's symptoms are certainly worrisome for a liver problem. Elevated liver enzymes can be due to a variety of causes, some benign and some serious. Since the white blood cell count is also high, this raises concern for an infection or inflammation somewhere in the body. Dehydration can be due to decreased fluid intake, increased fluid losses, or both.

Based on the information you provided, it seems like your mother is experiencing fluid accumulation, which could be a result of heart failure. However, I cannot confirm this without further examination and diagnostic tests.  Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to fluid accumulation in the body. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs and ankles.  If your mother has been diagnosed with heart failure, then the fluid accumulation she is experiencing may be a result of the condition. The tapping of fluid may be a temporary solution to relieve her symptoms, but further treatment may be necessary to manage her heart failure.  Going forward, your mother may require close monitoring and management of her heart failure. This may involve medications to help improve her heart function and reduce fluid accumulation, as well as lifestyle changes such as a low-salt diet and regular exercise.

The thickness of the endometrium that is measured in your pelvic ultrasound is within normal limits, however, there is an area of irregular mass that measures 2.6mm which is slightly thicker.

    "575": "Hello, The ALP or alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found in all body tissues but is highest in the liver, bile ducts, and bone. Therefore, an elevation can come from any of these sources. The most common cause of an elevated ALP is bone loss, which occurs with age and is more rapid in postmenopausal women and in some men. Paget's disease and osteoporosis are examples. In the liver, ALP elevations usually occur when the bile ducts are obstructed or inflamed. This can be caused by gallstones, inflammation of the bile ducts, hepatitis, cirrhosis, cancer, or infiltration of the bile ducts by disease such as sarcoidosis. An elevation of the ALP in association with an elevation of the AST and ALT would suggest liver disease. An isolated elevation of the ALP suggests bone loss or bile duct obstruction/disease. In your husband's case it would appear that his elevations are due to his liver disease. Regards.",

    "578": "Hello, thanks for using just answer. Acne is caused by a combination of factors. The most common is an overproduction of oil by the sebaceous glands in the skin. This excess oil, called sebum, blocks the pores, trapping dead skin cells and bacteria inside. The bacteria feed on the trapped oil and multiply, causing inflammation and infection. The resulting acne lesions can vary from non-inflammatory (open and closed comedones or blackheads and whiteheads) to inflammatory papules, pustules, nodules and cysts.  The following may help:  1. Avoid picking or squeezing the acne lesions as this can lead to scarring. 2. Keep your hair clean, especially if it is oily. Oily hair can cause acne on the forehead. 3. Keep your face clean. Wash your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser. Avoid scrubbing your face too hard or washing too often, as this can irritate your skin and make your acne worse. 4. Use oil-free cosmetics and hair products. Avoid products that contain oil, as these can clog your pores and cause acne. Look for the words \"noncomedogenic\" or \"nonacnegenic\" on the label. 5. Protect your skin from the sun. Some acne medications can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, and avoid spending too much time in the sun, especially between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when the sun's rays are strongest. If you are using benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, apply your sunscreen after you apply your acne medication. 6. Eat a healthy diet. There is no proof that certain foods cause acne, but eating a healthy diet can help keep your skin healthy. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limit your intake of fats and sugars. 7. Reduce stress. Stress doesn't cause acne, but it can make it worse. Try to reduce stress in your life by exercising, meditating, or doing other relaxing activities.  If you have tried all of these things and your acne is still not improving, talk to your doctor about other treatment options. Regards",

    "583": "Hi Vijesh, Thanks for writing to me. I am sorry to hear about your niece's health problem. ITP or Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system attacks its own platelets, leading to a low platelet count. While most cases of ITP are acute and resolve spontaneously, some cases can be chronic and require long-term treatment. The treatment for ITP typically involves immunosuppressive therapy to prevent the immune system from destroying platelets, as well as platelet transfusions to control bleeding symptoms. The use of steroids and rituximab is common in the treatment of ITP. However, it is important to note that each case of ITP is unique and may require individualized treatment. It is difficult to predict the outcome of treatment in your niece's case without a detailed understanding of her medical history and current clinical status. I would recommend that you continue to consult with her healthcare providers at Vanderbilt Hospital and consider seeking a second opinion from a specialist in hematology or immunology. I hope this information helps. Regards,",

    "586": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your father's condition. It sounds like he is making some progress with his physiotherapy exercises, which is great. However, it can be frustrating when progress is slow or seems to plateau. In terms of treatment, it sounds like your father is already doing the right things by doing regular physiotherapy and managing his sugar and blood pressure levels. These are both important for his overall health and for preventing further complications. In addition to these treatments, there are a few other options that may help improve his condition:\n\n1.

    "587": "Hello, Thanks for the query. If all your investigations are normal then there is no need to worry. CT scan is a very accurate investigation. If there was any abnormality it would have been picked up. Sometimes, due to vigorous exercise or minor trauma, there can be blood in the urine which is not a cause of worry. If you still have persistent blood in the urine then you may need further evaluation like cystoscopy where a small camera is introduced in the urinary passage to see any source of bleed. Hope this answers your query.",
    "588": "Stretch marks are caused by stretching of the skin beyond its normal limit. These are more commonly seen in women who get stretch marks in pregnancy when their skin gets stretched too fast too soon. Similarly these are seen in people who gain weight too fast and lose it too soon, and of course in your case where the skin was stretched to pull the foreskin over the glans and then sutured in place. These are nothing to worry about and will fade with time. Scar is never symmetrical and slopes to one side because the tension of the skin and underlying tissue is not the same on both sides. The fact that Plastibell circumcision pulls the foreskin over the glans causes asymmetry. I don't think there is any ointment which can make the scar fade away completely. Bio oil, scar fade etc can help improve the texture and appearance of the scar but can not make it disappear completely. I would suggest you to be patient and let the nature take its own course. If after a year or so you still feel that the scar is cosmetically unacceptable, then you may think of surgical correction which can improve the cosmetic appearance but again can not make it disappear completely.",

However, there are no acute findings, such as a mass effect or midline shift, and other brain structures are mentioned as normal.

    "653": "Hello! Thanks for sharing your concern. I can understand how you feel about your liver enzymes test results and the medication you are taking. Stopping Pravastatin for a month may help in decreasing the liver enzymes level as it can be a possible cause. However, it may not be the only reason for the elevation. Other factors such as alcohol consumption, obesity, viral hepatitis, and other medications can also contribute to the rise of liver enzymes. It is important to identify the underlying cause to prevent further liver damage. A month is a reasonable time to wait before retesting your liver enzymes. If the levels decreased, then it might be safe to resume taking Pravastatin. However, if the levels remain high or even increase, then further evaluation and management are necessary. It is best to discuss this with your doctor for proper management and guidance. Take care and keep healthy!",

I understand your concern regarding your daughter's hearing problem and frequent colds. Let me address each issue separately: 1. Hearing Loss: Homeopathy can be effective in treating hearing loss, depending on the underlying cause and the severity of the condition. However, it is important to understand that homeopathy may not be a complete substitute for conventional medical treatment, especially in cases of significant hearing loss. It is advisable to consult a qualified homeopathic physician who can assess your daughter's condition and suggest appropriate homeopathic remedies along with conventional treatment. 2. Frequent Colds: Homeopathy can also be effective in boosting your daughter's immunity and reducing the frequency of colds. However, it is important to identify the underlying cause of frequent colds, such as allergies or a weakened immune system. Some common homeopathic remedies that may help in reducing the frequency of colds include: - Arsenicum Album: This remedy is often prescribed for children who are fearful, anxious, and have a tendency to catch colds easily. It can help boost the immune system and reduce the severity of cold symptoms. - Allium Cepa: This remedy is useful for treating colds with profuse nasal discharge and sneezing. It can help reduce nasal congestion and improve breathing. 3. Nose Blockage and Sneezing: For nose blockage and sneezing, some simple home remedies that you can try at home include: - Saline nasal drops or sprays: These can help reduce nasal congestion and improve breathing. - Steaming: Bring water to a boil over a stove, remove from heat, and bring your daughter close to the steam. Cover her head with a towel and bring her close to the steam, inhaling deeply through the nose. This can help loosen nasal congestion and make breathing easier. - Humidifier: Using a humidifier in your daughter's room can help keep the air moist and reduce nasal congestion.

    "660": "Hi, I am sorry to hear about your mother's death and your sister's illness. At the time of death, there can be various body responses including muscle spasms and jerking movements due to lack of oxygen to the muscles. These movements can sometimes be misinterpreted as seizures. However, without an EEG recording, it is difficult to confirm whether the movement was actually a seizure or not. In regards to your concern about too much oxygen, it is actually not possible to give too much oxygen to the brain. The brain will only use the amount of oxygen that it needs and any excess will be exhaled by the lungs. In fact, giving oxygen at the time of death can help to ease the dying process and make the person more comfortable. It is a common practice to continue giving oxygen to a person who is dying, even if they are no longer able to breathe on their own. I hope this information helps to ease your concerns. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.",

    "739": "High blood pressure (BP) is a condition where the force of blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease.  Losartan (Losar) is a medication that is commonly used to treat high blood pressure.  It is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).  ARBs block the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow and blood pressure to increase.  By blocking the action of angiotensin II, losartan helps to relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure.\n\nIt is important to follow your doctor's recommendations regarding taking losartan.  If your doctor has prescribed losartan for you, it is because they have determined that you have high blood pressure and that treatment with medication is necessary.  Losartan is generally considered safe and effective for long-term use, but like all medications, it can cause side effects in some people.  Common side effects of losartan include dizziness, fatigue, and cough.\n\nIt is important to continue taking losartan as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel well.  High blood pressure often has no symptoms, so you may not feel any different even if your blood pressure is high.  However, high blood pressure can still cause damage to your blood vessels and organs if it is not treated.\n\nIn some cases, it may be possible to reduce your dose of losartan or stop taking it if your blood pressure is well-controlled with lifestyle changes such as exercise and a healthy diet.

Modern medicine and surgical techniques have greatly improved outcomes for cancer patients, and surgeons are trained to handle complex cases. However, as with any surgery, there are risks involved, and your aunt's medical team will discuss these risks with you in detail before the operation. I wish your aunt a speedy recovery and hope that the surgery is successful.",
    "759": "Hi, thanks for writing in to Chat Doctor. Green stools in babies can be due to a variety of reasons. The most common cause is nothing to worry about and is simply due to the baby's diet. If a baby is formula fed, the iron in the formula can cause green stools. If the baby is breastfed, then the mother's diet can also affect the baby's stool color. Green leafy vegetables in the mother's diet can cause green stools in the baby. However, green stools can also be a sign of a more serious problem like a cold, infection, or food allergy. If your baby's stool is green and there is mucus or blood present, or if the stool is very watery, then you should consult your pediatrician immediately. In your case, since the stool test results are normal and the baby is not showing any other symptoms of illness, it is likely that the green stools are due to dietary reasons. You can try giving your baby probiotics to help improve their digestive health. As for starting ragi porridge, it is best to consult your pediatrician before introducing any new foods to your baby's diet, especially if they are having digestive issues. Hope this helps!",

    "774": "Hello, Thank you for sharing your concern with Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and understand your concern. Impetigo is a common and highly contagious skin infection that usually affects infants and children. Staphylococcus aureus (staph) is one of the most common causes of impetigo. Impetigo usually clears up with proper treatment. However, in some cases, it may spread and become severe. In your son's case, the symptoms are severe and have not responded well to the previous treatment. Here are some suggestions that may help in treating your son's impetigo:  1. Keep the skin clean and dry: Use a mild soap and warm water to clean the affected areas. Pat the skin dry gently with a towel. 2. Apply mupirocin ointment: Mupirocin is an antibiotic ointment that is commonly used to treat impetigo. Apply a thin layer of mupirocin ointment on the affected areas as prescribed by your doctor. 3. Use a barrier cream: Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly or aloe vera gel on the skin around the affected areas. This will help to protect the skin from further infection and prevent the spread of impetigo. 4. Give your son a bath with bleach: Add a small amount of bleach (about 1/2 cup) to your son's bath water. This will help to kill the staph bacteria on the skin. 5. Keep your son's nails short: Long nails can scratch the skin and lead to further infection. Keep your son's nails short and clean. 6. Avoid close contact: Impetigo is highly contagious, so avoid close contact with your son as much as possible. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially after touching the affected areas.  If your son's symptoms do not improve within a few days or if they worsen, please consult your doctor immediately. Your doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics or recommend other treatment options depending on the severity of the infection.",

    "789": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Mirena contains Levonorgestrel which is a progesterone hormone. It is released in small amounts into your uterus to prevent pregnancy for up to 5 years. Irregular bleeding or spotting may occur for the first 3-6 months after Mirena is placed. However, some women may have irregular bleeding or spotting for the entire time Mirena is in place. This is because Mirena works by thinning the lining of your uterus (endometrium). Sometimes, the endometrium may become so thin that it sheds in small amounts, causing spotting. If you have had Mirena for nearly 4 years and are experiencing increased discharge, it may be due to hormonal changes or an infection. It is important to schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms and to determine the cause of the discharge. They may recommend additional testing or treatment if necessary. Ok and bye.",

Given your age and AMH level, it is indicating that your ovarian reserve is low and the quality and quantity of eggs you are producing is also reduced.

    "846": "Hello Mahr Waqar! Thank you for reaching out to me regarding your health. I am here to help you with your concerns about your SGPT level.\n\nFirst of all, SGPT or Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase is an enzyme found in the liver. When the liver is damaged or inflamed, this enzyme leaks out into the bloodstream, causing an increase in SGPT levels. The normal range for SGPT is usually between 7 to 55 units per liter (U/L). However, different labs may have different normal ranges.\n\nIn your case, your SGPT level is 57 U/L, which is slightly higher than the normal range. However, it is not a very high value and can be easily brought down with some lifestyle modifications and home remedies.\n\nHere are some tips that can help you lower your SGPT level naturally:\n\n1. Hydrate yourself: Drink plenty of water and fluids to keep yourself hydrated. This helps in flushing out toxins from the liver and improves its function.\n2. Avoid alcohol: Avoid alcohol consumption as it can cause liver damage and increase SGPT levels.\n3. Limit processed foods: Avoid processed foods, junk foods, and sugary snacks as they can cause inflammation in the liver.\n4. Increase fiber intake: Include fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes in your diet. This helps in detoxifying the liver and improving its function.\n5. Take liver-friendly herbs: Herbs like milk thistle, dandelion root, and turmeric have liver-protecting properties and can help in lowering SGPT levels.\n6. Exercise regularly: Regular exercise helps in improving liver function and lowering SGPT levels.\n7. Get enough sleep: Adequate sleep is essential for the proper functioning of the liver. Lack of sleep can cause liver damage and increase SGPT levels.\n\nBy following these tips, you can bring down your SGPT level naturally within a few days. However, if you have any underlying medical condition or if your SGPT level is very high, it is advisable to consult a doctor for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nI hope this information helps you in managing your SGPT level.

They may suggest physical therapy or a pessary to help support the prolapsed structure and alleviate your symptoms. Wishing you a speedy recovery!",
    "861": "Hello dear, thanks for your query on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. First of all, take care of yourself, so that you can take care of your mom better. I must tell you that lung transplantation is not a routine procedure and has lots of limitations. It is not done in India till date, and only few centers in the world are doing it. Also, lung transplantation has its own limitations like rejection, need for lifelong immunosuppressants and its side effects. Your mom is having destroyed lung due to TB which is infectious and can recur after transplantation too. Also, her age and other associated co-morbidities make her a poor candidate for lung transplantation. So better to focus on good medical care, supportive care and make her comfortable. Hope this will help you for sure. Wishing her fine recovery. Regards.",
    "862": "Hi, Thanks for writing to us. From your symptoms, it seems that you had a cold followed by vomiting and fainting. The fainting could be due to severe dehydration caused by vomiting. The dizziness you are experiencing now could be due to the after effects of the cold or due to some medication you might have taken.

    "863": "Hello, thanks for reaching out. It sounds like your daughter is experiencing severe anxiety at bedtime, which is affecting her sleep and causing distress for the whole family. It's not uncommon for children to have fears and anxieties, but when they persist and worsen over time, it may be necessary to seek professional help. I would recommend that you consult with a mental health professional who specializes in treating children and adolescents. They can help identify the underlying causes of her anxiety and develop an appropriate treatment plan. In the meantime, you can try some of the following strategies to help manage her anxiety: Create a safe and comforting sleep environment for her, such as using night lights, soft music, or a comfort object like a stuffed animal. Establish a consistent bedtime routine that includes calming activities, such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or doing some relaxation exercises. Encourage her to express her fears and worries openly and without judgment. Listen attentively and validate her feelings, but also help her understand that she is safe and loved. Gradually expose her to her fears using a technique called gradual exposure. This involves gradually increasing her exposure to the feared stimulus (in this case, darkness and sleeping alone) in a controlled and safe setting. This should be done under the guidance of a mental health professional. I hope these suggestions are helpful. Best of luck to you and your family.",

However, based on the information you provided, it is unlikely that your friend's condition is contagious or that you will get something with sexual intercourse. Radioactive materials or chemicals that may have entered your friend's bloodstream are not typically transmitted through casual contact or sexual activity.

Best wishes to you and your friend for a speedy recovery.",
    "865": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection which is contagious and can be transmitted by direct skin to skin contact. The lesions may not appear immediately after the contact and it may take time for the lesions to appear. Since your partner has developed lesions after having sex with you, there is a possibility that you might have transmitted the infection to him. However, it is not necessary that you should have lesions to transmit the infection. Your doctor is correct that it may take several weeks to months for the lesions to appear. It is also possible that your partner might have contracted the infection from some other source like a swimming pool or a shared towel. I would advise you to get yourself tested for Molluscum contagiosum to confirm if you are carrying the infection. Thank you",

    "868": "Hello, Thanks for writing in to us. Greenish stool in a 6 month old baby can be due to various reasons. It can be due to infection, indigestion or due to some new food that has been introduced. Since your baby has been exclusively breastfed, infection would be the most common cause. Administration of vaccines can also cause changes in the stool color and consistency. However, since your baby has completed the vaccine schedule, it is less likely to be the cause of greenish stool. I would advise you to continue with Enterogermina for a few more days and observe for any improvement. If there is no improvement, then please consult your pediatrician who may advise stool examination and other investigations to identify the cause of greenish stool. In the meantime, make sure that your baby is well hydrated and is not showing any signs of dehydration like dry mouth, sunken eyes, or decreased urine output.

As per your description, you have an 8 mm stone in your gallbladder with continuous pain on the lower left side of your stomach. Gallstones are hard deposits that form inside your gallbladder, a small organ under your liver that stores bile, a digestive fluid. These stones can cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms. Sometimes, they can block the flow of bile, leading to serious complications. Medications can help dissolve some types of gallstones, but they are not effective for everyone. If your doctor has advised surgery, it is likely because the stone is causing symptoms or because there is a risk of serious complications. It is best to follow your doctor's advice and have the surgery done as soon as possible. However, if you are unable to travel immediately, you can continue taking the medication prescribed by your doctor to manage the symptoms. It is important to avoid fatty foods and lose weight if you are overweight, as this can help reduce the risk of complications.

    "875": "Hello, thanks for reaching out. The numbness you are experiencing could be due to a variety of factors, including nerve compression or damage, poor circulation, or a combination of these factors. Given your history of heavy alcohol use, smoking, and high blood pressure, it is possible that these factors are contributing to your symptoms. Smoking and alcohol use can both damage blood vessels and nerves, which can lead to numbness and other sensory symptoms. Additionally, high blood pressure can also damage blood vessels and lead to poor circulation, which can cause numbness. It is important for you to address these lifestyle factors in order to potentially improve your symptoms. Quitting smoking and reducing your alcohol intake can help to improve your overall health and potentially reduce your risk of developing more serious health problems in the future. Additionally, regular exercise can help to improve circulation and potentially reduce numbness symptoms.

    "876": "Hello, thanks for reaching out. The salty taste in your mouth could be due to a number of reasons. One possibility is that you are indeed ingesting too much sodium, as you mentioned. Canned vegetables often contain high amounts of sodium, so it's possible that this is contributing to the salty taste in your mouth. Another possibility is that the salty taste is coming from the hole in your molar. When a cavity filling falls out, it can leave an exposed area of the tooth that is more prone to bacterial infection. This infection can sometimes cause a salty taste in the mouth. I would recommend trying to cut back on your sodium intake and see if that helps to resolve the issue. Additionally, you should make an appointment with a dentist as soon as possible to have the hole in your molar repaired. In the meantime, make sure to continue cleaning the area properly to prevent further infection.",

However, dialysis is usually recommended when creatinine levels are much higher, typically above 6-8 mg/dL depending on other associated factors.

HBsAg is found in the blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and other body fluids of persons infected with the virus. It may also be found on surfaces that have come into contact with these fluids, such as shared needles or other medical equipment. If you are HBsAg reactive, it means you are currently infected with hepatitis B. However, being anti-HBs reactive means you have developed antibodies to the virus, which usually indicates recovery and immunity. In general, people who are HBsAg reactive and anti-HBs reactive are not considered contagious and are not at risk of developing chronic hepatitis B. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, and your individual situation should be evaluated by a healthcare provider. As for working in a medical institution, it depends on the policies of the specific institution. Some hospitals may require employees to be vaccinated against hepatitis B, while others may not.

INR is also used to monitor patients with mechanical heart valves, those with atrial fibrillation (not caused by a heart valve problem), and those with a history of blood clots, among others. Warfarin prevents the formation of blood clots by interfering with vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the blood. Foods that are higher in vitamin K can decrease the effectiveness of warfarin and lower your INR. Foods lower in vitamin K can have the opposite effect. The INR is affected by many factors. Do you have any recent illness? Are you taking any new medications? Have you made any recent changes in your diet? Are you taking any new herbal or dietary supplements? These can all affect your INR. You may need to have your doctor check for other reasons for your INR to drop like thyroid dysfunction, liver dysfunction, vitamin deficiency etc. I hope this information helps you. Get Well Soon.",

Sometimes after hernia repair, some patients might experience leakage of fat or serous fluid from the surgical site which might be due to the accumulation of fat in the subcutaneous tissue or due to oozing of serous fluid from the surgical site.

However, if the leakage is excessive or if it persists for a longer period of time then it might be an indication of infection or some other complication. I would suggest you to have patience and observe your mother's condition for a few more days. If the leakage persists or if there is any sign of infection like redness, swelling or pain then you should immediately consult your surgeon. I hope this information helps you.

    "1085": "Hello Anjan. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and understand your concern. I would like to reply as follows:1. It is not uncommon to have allergies to dust and smoke, and it is natural to have symptoms of sneezing, running nose, nasal congestion, etc., when exposed to such allergens.2. The tablet you are taking, Montek LC, contains montelukast and levocetirizine, which are effective in controlling symptoms of allergic rhinitis (nasal allergy) and asthma. However, these tablets do not \"cure\" allergy, they only control symptoms. So, if you stop taking them, symptoms may recur.3. Duonase (fluticasone nasal spray) is a steroid nasal spray which reduces inflammation in the nose and sinuses and helps in controlling symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Again, it does not cure allergy, it only controls symptoms.4. Allegra (fexofenadine) is another antihistamine which is effective in controlling symptoms of allergic rhinitis.5. From your history, it appears that you have been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis and you are on treatment with Montek LC for 8 months. It is natural to have recurrence of symptoms if you miss your medication.6. My suggestion to you would be to continue taking Montek LC regularly as prescribed by your doctor. If you have symptoms even after taking Montek LC regularly, please consult your doctor for re-evaluation and possible change of treatment.7. In addition to medication, it is also important to avoid exposure to dust and smoke as much as possible. Use a mask when you are exposed to dust or smoke.8. Regular steam inhalation and nasal irrigation with saline water can also help in reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis.9. Please do not worry too much about your condition as it is common and can be controlled with proper treatment and avoidance of allergens.10. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health. Thank you & Regards.",

I understand that you are worried about your health and I will try my best to provide you with the information you need. A nodule in the lung can be caused by various reasons like infection, inflammation, or even cancer. However, not all nodules are cancerous. The size, shape, and appearance of the nodule on imaging tests can help determine the cause. Since you have never smoked, it reduces the risk of lung cancer. The fact that you are coughing more at night or when excited could be due to the position of the nodule or the presence of some irritants in the air that you are inhaling. I would advise you to get a follow-up CT scan or PET scan to further evaluate the nodule. This will help to determine if the nodule is growing or if there are any other abnormalities in the lungs. If the nodule is not growing and appears benign, your doctor may recommend watchful waiting and regular follow-up appointments to monitor the nodule. I hope this information helps you.

There is some other reason for high TLC like steroids, other medications or a different kind of sickness. 3. The TLC count is falsely high.  I would suggest getting a repeat TLC after 1 week and if it's still high, then a blood smear should be done to rule out any other causes.

The ointment that you are using is an antibiotic ointment that helps prevent infection in minor cuts, scrapes, and burns.

    "1197": "Hello Marion, thanks for sharing your medical concern with me. Let me first address each finding in your ultrasound report and then suggest what you should do. \n\n1. Adequate fetal movements: This is a reassuring finding and indicates that your baby is active and moving well within the womb.\n\n2. Placenta in the anterior position and not low lying: The placenta is the organ that provides nutrients and oxygen to your baby. The anterior position means that it is located at the front of your uterus, which is a normal position. The report also indicates that the placenta is not low lying, which means it is not close to or covering the cervix. This is good news as a low-lying placenta can sometimes cause bleeding or other complications during pregnancy.\n\n3. Nuchal cord twice: This finding refers to the presence of the baby's umbilical cord around its neck twice. While this can sound alarming, it is actually a common occurrence and usually resolves itself without any issues. However, your doctor will likely want to monitor your baby closely to ensure that the cord does not become tightened or compressed, which can be dangerous.\n\n4. Competent cervix measuring 4.5 cm: The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that opens into the vagina. A competent cervix means that it is closed and firm, which helps to prevent premature birth. The measurement of 4.5 cm refers to the length of the cervix, which is within the normal range.\n\nOverall, these findings suggest that your pregnancy is progressing normally, and there are no major concerns at this time. However, your doctor will likely want to monitor your baby closely given the nuchal cord and may recommend additional ultrasounds or other tests to ensure everything is going well. Best regards...",

    "1232": "Hello, thanks for consulting me. Nocturnal emissions or night falls are quite common in young adults and are not a cause of worry. They occur due to the accumulation of semen in the prostatic glands which needs to be ejaculated periodically. However, if you feel that they are occurring too frequently, you can try the following: 1. Avoid any kind of sexual stimulation or excitement before going to bed. This includes watching porn, reading erotic material, or even having sexually explicit conversations. 2. Wear loose and comfortable clothing, especially around the genital area. Tight underwear or pants can cause irritation and lead to night falls. 3. Try to empty your urinary bladder before going to bed. A full bladder can put pressure on the prostatic glands and cause night falls. 4. Engage in physical activity or exercise regularly to reduce stress and anxiety levels. Stress and anxiety can lead to increased sexual arousal and night falls. 5. If you are still concerned about night falls, you can consult a sexologist or a urologist who can guide you further.

    "1242": "Hello, thanks for reaching out. I understand your concern regarding your son's swollen lymph node. It is not uncommon for lymph nodes to remain swollen for an extended period of time after an infection, such as mono, even if the infection has cleared up. This is because the lymph nodes are part of the immune system's response to fight off infections, and they can become enlarged as they work to filter out harmful substances. It is possible that the lymph node may not return to its normal size, but this does not necessarily indicate a problem. As long as your son is healthy and active, and there are no other symptoms present, it is likely that the lymph node is simply a residual effect of the previous infection. However, if you are still concerned, I recommend that you schedule a follow-up appointment with your son's pediatrician or a specialist to further evaluate the lymph node.",

To prevent the spread of pinworms, it is important to wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom and before eating. You should also avoid touching your face and mouth with unwashed hands. It is a good idea to clean the store thoroughly, especially the areas that the woman came into contact with.

    "1252": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor.  It is nice of you to write to us.  I went through your query and understand your concern.  You had paragard inserted for the first time 3 days ago and you are having excessive gas and bloating from the gas for 2 days and also had intermittent bleeding with a very thick mucousy liquid.  You want to know how long to expect these symptoms and what you can do to make them subside.  You are not in pain and you are nearly more concerned about the gas as it gets very uncomfortable sometimes to the point of pain, especially at night.  First of all, let me tell you that, sometimes after insertion of paragard, some women may have these kinds of symptoms due to the body adjusting to the paragard.  How long will these symptoms last will vary depending on each individual.  Some women may have these symptoms for a week or two and some may not have any symptoms at all.  As for the excessive gas and bloating, this may be due to the body adjusting to the paragard or it could be due to something else like changes in diet or hormone levels.  To help relieve the gas and bloating, you can try the following:  Avoid gas-producing foods like beans, broccoli, cabbage, and carbonated beverages.  Drink water and other clear liquids to help flush out your system.  Take over-the-counter gas relief medication like Beano or Gas-X.  As for the intermittent bleeding and thick mucousy liquid, this is also common after paragard insertion.  This is because the body is adjusting to the paragard and the uterus is contracting to expel the foreign object.  This can cause some bleeding and discharge.  To help relieve these symptoms, you can try the following:  Use sanitary pads to absorb any discharge.  Take over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen to help with any cramping or discomfort.  Rest and avoid any strenuous activity.",

    "1257": "Hello, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. You have had palpitations and were diagnosed with self-terminating runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). VT is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that starts in the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart. RVOT is a specific location in the heart where VT can originate. Self-terminating means that the VT stopped on its own without any treatment. This is generally a good sign, as it suggests that the VT may not be dangerous. However, it is important to note that VT can sometimes be a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. The beta-blocker bisoprolol is often used to treat palpitations and VT, and it can be effective in preventing future episodes.

    "1266": "Hello, Congratulations on your pregnancy. I understand your concern regarding the elevated ALT levels and clay colored stools. However, it is unlikely that the aciphex you are taking for heartburn is causing drug-induced hepatitis. Aciphex is generally well-tolerated and does not commonly cause liver problems. Clay colored stools can be caused by a variety of factors, including changes in diet or medication, and do not necessarily indicate a serious problem. However, your OB will likely want to investigate further to rule out any potential causes of liver dysfunction, including preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-induced hypertension with liver dysfunction and can present with elevated liver enzymes and abnormal liver function tests. However, other symptoms such as high blood pressure, protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet are also present. Your OB will likely perform additional tests to evaluate your liver function and rule out any potential causes of liver dysfunction, including preeclampsia. Keep in mind that elevated liver enzymes can occur in normal, healthy pregnancies and may not indicate a serious problem. However, it is important to follow up with your OB as soon as possible to further investigate your symptoms and ensure the health of you and your baby. Best of luck to you and your growing family!",

In general, treatment for hepatitis B includes antiviral medications, liver-protecting medications, and lifestyle modifications. Antiviral medications are used to slow down or stop the virus from replicating and causing further damage to the liver. These medications are usually taken orally and may be prescribed for a period of several months to years. Liver-protecting medications are used to help the liver function properly and to prevent further damage. These may include supplements like vitamin E, silymarin, and others. In addition to medication, self-care is an important aspect of managing hepatitis B. This includes: 1. Getting enough rest: Hepatitis B can cause fatigue, so it's important to get adequate rest. 2. Eating a healthy diet: A balanced diet is important for overall health and can help support liver function. 3. Avoiding alcohol: Alcohol can cause further damage to the liver and should be avoided. 4. Quitting smoking: Smoking can also damage the liver and should be stopped. 5. Regular monitoring: Regular monitoring of liver function tests and a liver biopsy can help detect any changes in the liver and guide treatment. It's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a treatment plan that's right for you.",
    "1284": "Hello, thanks for posting your query. I can understand your concern. The SGOT and SGPT levels are an indication of liver function tests and their levels can go up if there is any liver injury or inflammation going on. There are multiple causes that can lead to a rise in liver enzymes like viral hepatitis, alcohol intake, drugs, obesity, metabolic disorders, autoimmune disorders, etc. However, in your case, since you are negative for hep B and C, do not drink alcohol frequently and are not overweight, it is less likely to be due to these causes. It is advisable to get a detailed evaluation done by a gastroenterologist to look into other possible causes of liver injury like metabolic disorders, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, etc. Also, sometimes, medications like antibiotics, painkillers, etc can also cause a rise in liver enzymes. It is important to rule out any underlying cause before coming to a conclusion.",

    "1319": "Hello Tami, Thanks for contacting Chat Doctor for your medical questions. I am sorry to hear about your EEG results and your health concerns. The EEG (electroencephalogram) measures the electrical activity in your brain. If the EEG shows too much electrical activity on the left side of your brain, it could indicate that there is abnormal activity in that area. However, it is important to note that an EEG alone cannot diagnose a specific condition. It can only provide information about the electrical activity in your brain. The fact that you have never had a seizure is important information. Seizures are one possible cause of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, but there are other possible causes as well. For example, some medications, including triptans which are used to treat migraines, can cause changes in brain activity that can be seen on an EEG. Other possible causes of abnormal electrical activity in the brain include brain injury, brain tumors, and certain neurological disorders. The fact that your walking and memory problems occurred after neck surgery is also important information. It is possible that the neck surgery could have caused changes in the electrical activity in your brain, although this is not certain. It is also possible that the neck surgery could have caused damage to the nerves or other structures in the neck that could be contributing to your symptoms. Given your complex medical history and the uncertainty of your diagnosis, I would recommend that you see a neurologist for further evaluation and testing. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating conditions that affect the brain and nervous system. They will be able to perform a more thorough evaluation and order any additional tests that may be necessary to help diagnose your condition. I hope this information has been helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Take care and stay healthy!",

Surgery may be recommended if the disc protrusion is severe and causing significant neurological symptoms such as weakness or numbness in your arms or hands.\n\nThe duration of the treatment process varies depending on the severity of your condition and the chosen treatment modality.

When the body is under stress, it releases stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which can cause the stomach to produce more acid than usual, leading to nausea and bloating. Skipping meals can also contribute to nausea and bloating as it can disrupt the normal rhythm of the digestive system.  Had I been your doctor, I would advise you to make some lifestyle changes to help reduce your stress levels. This may include practices such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. It is also important to make time for meals and to eat a balanced diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

    "1345": "The primary goal of treatment for this patient should be to improve blood sugar control and promote healing of the non-healing ulcers on both great toes. This can be achieved through a combination of medical management and wound care.\n\nMedical management should focus on optimizing the patient's diabetes treatment regimen to lower her HbA1c level and improve overall glycemic control. This may involve adjustments to her current medication regimen, as well as lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes and increased physical activity.\n\nWound care for the non-healing ulcers should involve a multidisciplinary approach, including input from a podiatrist or wound care specialist. Options may include debridement of the ulcers to remove dead tissue, application of topical treatments to promote healing, and the use of special shoes or orthotics to reduce pressure on the toes and promote healing.\n\nIn addition to these measures, the patient should be educated on proper foot care and hygiene to prevent future ulcers and complications.

If you can walk on it and there is no tenderness on pushing, then most probably it is not fractured.

    "1348": "Hello! Thanks for getting in touch with Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Nightfall or wet dreams is a common occurrence in young adults. It is caused by a variety of factors including sexual arousal, stress, anxiety, hormonal imbalances, certain medications, and even certain foods. However, it is not a cause for concern as it does not affect your physical health in any way. It is just your body's way of releasing semen that has accumulated in the prostate gland. If you are feeling unhealthy or experiencing fatigue, it could be due to other reasons such as lack of sleep, poor diet, lack of exercise, or other medical conditions. It is advisable to consult a doctor for a thorough physical examination and to rule out any underlying medical conditions. In the meantime, you can try the following to reduce the frequency of nightfall: 1. Avoid watching pornographic material before bed. 2. Try to relax before going to sleep by listening to soft music or doing some light reading. 3. Avoid sleeping on your stomach as it can put pressure on your genitals and cause nightfall. 4. Wear loose-fitting boxers or pajamas to prevent friction and arousal. 5. Try to have a regular sleep schedule and get adequate rest. I hope this helps!

    "1357": "Hello, It is very unusual that you are linking your current problems to birth control shot you had at age 19. It is even more unusual that you think your ovaries are causing your problem yet all tests are normal. The only link between your ovaries and your current problem is the fact that you have heavy periods lasting 10 days. This may or may not be related to your current symptoms. I would advice that you see a neurologist who will be able to perform tests to see how well your brain is functioning and what may be causing your falls and poor gait. They may also be able to advice if a hysterectomy or tubal ligation is appropriate for you. A hysterectomy is a major surgery and should not be undertaken lightly, especially if you are considering it for non-medical reasons. Tubal ligation is also a surgical procedure that involves cutting and sealing the fallopian tubes, which can have its own risks and complications. I would advice that you explore all other options before considering surgery. Regards.",

To improve the quality of sperm, you can include fruits like bananas, pomegranates, and strawberries in your diet as they are rich in antioxidants and vitamins that support sperm health.

Additionally, you mentioned that you had to stop taking one of your medications due to BKVirus.\n\nIn general, creatinine levels are used as a marker of kidney function. The normal range for creatinine levels can vary depending on the laboratory and the test method used. However, in general, a creatinine level of 2.3 to 2.5 mg/dL is considered to be high and may indicate that your kidneys are not functioning properly.\n\nAs for whether these levels consider you disabled or not, this is a determination that is typically made by your healthcare provider or a disability evaluation agency.

    "1368": "Hello! I can understand why you might be worried about these results, but try not to panic just yet. Low levels of testosterone are common in men as they age and can cause a decrease in sex drive, energy, and muscle mass. It is treatable with hormone replacement therapy. Low levels of vitamin D are also common and can be easily treated with supplements. As for the cholesterol, a low level is actually a good thing and means you are at a lower risk for heart disease. The WBC count being low could mean a few things such as an increased risk of infections, autoimmune disorders, or chronic fatigue syndrome. However, it could also be normal for you and not cause any problems. The high lymphocyte and monocyte counts could indicate an infection or inflammation somewhere in the body, but again, it could be normal for you. It is unlikely that these results indicate cancer, but a hematologist will be able to run more tests to investigate further and rule out any serious causes. Try not to worry too much until you have seen the specialist and gotten a proper diagnosis.",

In your case it seems to be musculoskeletal cause due to the description of the pain. It could be costochondritis or pleurisy. Costochondritis is an inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone, and pleurisy is inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs. These conditions can cause pain when taking a deep breath or coughing and can feel like a heart attack. As the person cannot take dye due to allergies, MRI or CT cannot be done. Acupuncture can help in relieving pain but it is important to get a proper diagnosis. Candida infection can cause various health problems but it is not related to the current symptoms. The surgery in 2009 and antibiotics taken for a long time can have an impact on the overall health of the person. It is good that the person is seeing a Naturopathic doctor.

As for the possible conception dates, it's difficult to determine exactly when conception occurred based on the information provided. However, given that you had sex on August 4th, 6th, and 17th, it's possible that conception could have occurred on any of those days. It's also important to note that ultrasound dating can be off by a few days in either direction, so it's possible that your actual due date could be slightly earlier or later than April 28th. Additionally, it's worth noting that subtracting two weeks from the ultrasound date is a rough estimate and may not be accurate in all cases. Your last menstrual period was on July 26th, which means that you were likely ovulating around August 9th. This would put conception on or around August 9th, which is consistent with the ultrasound dating. However, every pregnancy is unique and there can be variations in how quickly a baby develops, so it's important to continue to follow up with your healthcare provider for more personalized guidance.",

This may include regular chiropractic adjustments, physical therapy, and exercises specifically tailored to strengthen your back muscles. As for your husband's concerns, it is important to have an open and honest discussion about your health and the risks involved with pregnancy.

It is important to follow up with your pulmonologist to further evaluate your condition and determine if any further treatment or monitoring is necessary. As for securing a medical certificate before undergoing pre-employment medical exam, it would be best to check with your employer or the company's medical department to see if they require any specific documentation. Your pulmonologist can provide you with a medical certificate stating your diagnosis, treatment, and current status which you can then submit to your employer if needed.

    "1381": "I'm sorry to hear about your partner's chronic pain and the limited success with various treatments. It can be frustrating and overwhelming to manage chronic pain, especially when conventional medications don't provide relief. Since acupuncture has been the only effective treatment so far, it's worth exploring alternative options that may provide similar benefits.\n\nOne possibility is to look into dry needling, which is a technique that uses acupuncture needles to target trigger points and muscle tension. This may help alleviate some of the pain your partner is experiencing. Additionally, you may want to consider transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which uses mild electrical pulses to interrupt pain signals and provide relief.\n\nOther non-pharmaceutical options include mind-body therapies such as yoga, tai chi, or meditation, which have been shown to help manage chronic pain in some cases. You could also explore topical treatments like capsaicin cream or menthol-based gels that may provide localized pain relief.\n\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare professional before trying any new treatments, especially if your partner has a history of medication resistance or other health conditions. They can help you develop a comprehensive pain management plan tailored to your partner's specific needs and circumstances.",

There are a few things that need to be considered here. Parkinson's disease patients are at higher risk of developing dental problems due to the difficulty in maintaining oral hygiene and also due to the side effects of some of the medications used to treat Parkinson's.

Your description indicates that the bone fragments are out of alignment (displaced), and angulated towards the palm.  The fracture fragments are also overlapping.  Although there is no subluxation or dislocation, and the articular cortex (the outer layer of bone that covers the joint surface) is intact, the displacement and angulation of the bone fragments may affect hand function and cause pain or limitation of motion.  Given that it has been two weeks since the injury occurred, and assuming that the fracture has not been treated, the best course of action would be to consult a hand surgeon or an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and management.  Treatment options may include closed reduction and casting, percutaneous pinning, or open reduction and internal fixation, depending on the severity of the fracture and the surgeon's preference.  The goal of treatment is to align the bone fragments, stabilize the fracture, and allow for proper healing, which will ultimately lead to the most mobility back in your hand.

    "1426": "Dear Joan, MRSA stands for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that commonly causes skin infections in humans. MRSA is a strain of Staphylococcus aureus that is resistant to methicillin and other antibiotics that are commonly used to treat Staphylococcus aureus infections. MRSA infections occur most frequently among persons in hospitals and healthcare facilities (such as nursing homes and dialysis centers) who have weakened immune systems or are receiving medical treatments that increase their risk for infection. MRSA can be spread from person to person by direct skin-to-skin contact, and by indirect contact with shared items or surfaces (such as towels, razors, athletic equipment, and medical equipment) that have come into contact with the infection on someone's skin. MRSA can cause a wide variety of illnesses, ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening bloodstream infections, pneumonia, and surgical site infections. MRSA can become dormant (inactive) in some cases, but it can also reactivate and cause infection. It is not clear whether MRSA can be passed from person to person by handling the elements during Eucharistic service. However, to reduce the risk of transmission of MRSA and other infections, it is important to practice good hygiene, including washing your hands frequently with soap and water and covering any cuts or abrasions on your skin. If you have any concerns about MRSA or other infections, you should consult with your healthcare provider or the health department in your area. Thank you for your question.",

    "1442": "Hello, Congratulations on your wife's pregnancy. I understand your concern regarding the medications your wife is taking for lymph node TB and their potential side effects on the fetus. The drugs your wife is taking, Oxfloxacin, INH, and Ethambutol, are commonly used to treat TB. However, the use of these drugs during pregnancy is not without potential risks. There is some evidence to suggest that these drugs may have teratogenic effects, meaning they could potentially cause birth defects. The risk of birth defects is higher when these drugs are taken during the first trimester of pregnancy, which is the period of organ formation. However, the risk of birth defects is still relatively low, and the benefits of treating TB usually outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.

    "1471": "Hello! It's great that you're asking about the interactions between your birth control and antibiotics. It's important to be aware of these interactions so that you can avoid any unintended pregnancy. The antibiotics can make the pills less effective by interfering with the way that the pills work in your body. This can happen in a few different ways. For example, the antibiotics might cause your body to metabolize the pills more quickly than usual, which would reduce the amount of time that the pills have to work. Alternatively, the antibiotics might bind to the pills and prevent them from being absorbed into your bloodstream, which would also reduce their effectiveness. In general, it's a good idea to use a back-up method of birth control when you're taking antibiotics, just to be safe. It's best to use a back-up method for the entire time that you're taking the antibiotics, plus seven days after you finish the course. This will help to ensure that you're protected against unintended pregnancy. So, in your case, since you're on your second month of your jolessa pack, you should use a back-up method for the remainder of this month and for the next seven days after you finish the antibiotics. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

Sometimes, tumors can be missed on PET scans, especially if they are small or if there is a lot of other activity in the area. It is possible that the tumors in your husband's shoulder were missed on the initial PET scan. Corticosteroid injections like cortisone are commonly used to treat pain and inflammation, but they can also stimulate the growth of cancer cells. However, it is unlikely that the cortisone shot caused the tumors to grow in your husband's shoulder. It is more likely that the tumors were already present but not detected on the initial imaging studies. It is also possible that the cancer doctor did not find the tumors because they were not looking specifically for them or because the tumors were too small to be detected on the imaging studies at that time.

In case of any abnormalities detected on the above investigations, appropriate management should be given.  In case of normal findings on the above investigations, the following management options can be considered. 1. Medications like antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, selenium, folic acid, etc., which would aid in improving the sperm quality and quantity. 2. Life style modifications like avoiding smoking, alcohol, drugs, excessive heat exposure, tight undergarments, etc., which would aid in improving the sperm quality and quantity. 3. Assisted reproductive techniques like Intrauterine insemination (IUI), Invitro fertilization (IVF), Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), etc., can be considered in case of failure of natural conception after trying for a year or more.  Hope the information provided would be helpful.  All the best.",
    "1481": "Hi there, I understand your concern regarding the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease when your symptoms seem to be related to physical problems. However, I must clarify that doctors do not receive orders from drug companies and their primary goal is to provide accurate diagnoses and effective treatments for their patients. Sometimes, symptoms can overlap with other conditions, making it difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. In such cases, doctors may consider various possibilities and run tests to rule out or confirm certain conditions. I would recommend seeking a second opinion from another neurologist to get a fresh perspective on your case. Additionally, it is important to communicate any concerns or questions you have about your diagnosis and treatment plan with your healthcare provider.

    "1510": "Hi and thanks for the query. Yes, I can think of a couple of possibilities that might explain your high blood ammonia levels. Firstly, as you mentioned, gut bacteria can contribute to high ammonia levels. This is because bacteria in the gut can break down protein and produce ammonia as a by-product. If there is an overgrowth of certain types of bacteria in the gut, this could lead to increased ammonia production and subsequently, high blood ammonia levels. Secondly, Cipro is an antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those that may be present in the gut. It is possible that Cipro is helping to reduce the levels of ammonia-producing bacteria in your gut, which could explain why your ammonia levels return to normal when you take the medication. It is also important to note that the liver plays a key role in the metabolism and elimination of ammonia from the blood. Even if the liver appears unremarkable on a fiber optic scan, it may still not be functioning optimally, which could contribute to high blood ammonia levels. I hope this information helps.

It is possible that the change in weather could be contributing to your symptoms, as changes in temperature can sometimes cause muscles to become tight and sore.

    "1530": "Hello, Thanks for posting at Chat Doctor. I have gone through your description. You seem to be having an episode of PSVT (Paroxysmal Supra Ventricular Tachycardia). PSVT is a rhythm problem of the heart, where the heart beats very fast suddenly and then returns to normal. PSVT is not life threatening, but can be very uncomfortable. PSVT can be triggered by caffeine, alcohol, stress, lack of sleep etc. PSVT needs to be differentiated from VT (Ventricular Tachycardia) which is a life threatening rhythm problem. PSVT can be diagnosed by doing an ECG when the symptoms are present. PSVT can be prevented by avoiding caffeine, alcohol, stress and lack of sleep. PSVT episodes can be terminated by performing certain maneuvers called vagal maneuvers like carotid sinus massage, valsalva maneuver etc. If vagal maneuvers fail, then medications are required to terminate the PSVT episode. You should get an ECG done when the symptoms are present to confirm the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, your doctor will prescribe you medications to prevent future episodes of PSVT. I hope I have solved your query. Wishing you good health. Regards.",

    "1554": "Hello, thanks for reaching out. I have gone through your query. Crown preparation is an art and science. If the crown is sitting too low then there is some problem with the occlusion or the bite. The crown can be adjusted to correct the occlusion but if there is any crack in the tooth then removing the crown may cause further damage to the tooth. In such cases, it is always better to go for a re-cementation of the crown rather than adjusting it in the mouth. This will ensure that the crack does not propagate further and the tooth is not damaged. If you are not willing to remove the crown then you can ask your dentist to add some porcelain to the occlusal surface of the crown to increase its height. This can be done without removing the crown but it may not be as durable as a crown that is properly fitted and cemented. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

However, if you have any concerns or if you come into direct contact with a raccoon or any other wildlife, it is always recommended to seek medical attention and consult your doctor about the need for rabies shots.",

    "1691": "Hello! I can understand your concern. Hemodialysis is a treatment that does some of the work of healthy kidneys. It is called dialysis because it involves filtering waste and extra water out of the blood, just as healthy kidneys do. Hemodialysis is needed when kidneys can no longer filter blood effectively. Hemodialysis is done in a dialysis unit, either in a hospital or in a stand-alone dialysis center. It requires specialized equipment and trained personnel. During hemodialysis, blood flows from the patient's body into a dialyzer, which filters out waste and extra water. The cleaned blood then flows back into the patient's body. Hemodialysis can be done at home if the patient or a family member is trained to do it and has the necessary equipment. Some potential complications of hemodialysis include: 1. Allergic reactions to the dialysis membrane or dialysate solution 2. Hypotension (low blood pressure) 3. Imbalances of electrolytes such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium 4. Access problems such as clotting, infection, or stenosis (narrowing) of the vascular access site. I hope this information helps you understand hemodialysis better. If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask.",

If you miss a dose or experience any side effects, contact your doctor immediately. Additionally, if you are planning to become pregnant in the future, you should discuss your plans with your doctor ahead of time and stop using Krimson 35 as soon as possible. I hope this information helps. Best wishes for a happy and healthy married life.",

    "1761": "Hello Irene, thanks for writing to us. I am sorry to hear about your son's health condition. Cirrhosis is a serious liver disease that can be caused by various factors, including viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, and metabolic disorders. To determine the stage of cirrhosis, several tests and examinations are needed. Here are some of the tests that your son may need: 1. Physical examination: The doctor will examine your son's abdomen to check for any signs of liver disease, such as enlarged liver or spleen, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), or jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). 2. Blood tests: Blood tests can help assess the liver function and detect any abnormalities. The doctor may order tests such as liver function tests (LFTs), which measure the levels of different enzymes and proteins in the blood that are produced by the liver. Other blood tests may include a complete blood count (CBC) to check for anemia, and tests to check for viral hepatitis or other liver diseases. 3. Imaging tests: Imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI can help visualize the liver and detect any structural abnormalities or signs of cirrhosis. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create images of the liver, while a CT scan or MRI uses X-rays or magnetic fields to produce detailed images. 4. Biopsy: A liver biopsy involves taking a small sample of liver tissue for examination under a microscope. This is the most accurate way to diagnose cirrhosis and determine its stage. However, it is an invasive procedure and may not be suitable for all patients. I hope this information helps you understand the tests and examinations that your son may need. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Best regards, Chat Doctor.",

Coughs can be worrying, especially when they are hard and the child doesn't know how to spit out the phlegm. Ambroxol mucosolvan is a good medicine for helping to clear mucus from the airways, but if it's not helping enough, there are other options available.

You could also try giving him steam inhalations or using a humidifier to help moisten his airways and make coughing easier.\n\nAs for bathing, it's generally fine to give your son a bath even if he doesn't have a fever. Bathing can actually help to ease congestion and make your son feel more comfortable.

Additionally, you should be checked for inner ear stones (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo) which can cause episodes of vertigo and unsteadiness triggered by certain head movements. You should also be checked for Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV) which is characterized by recurrent vertigo, migraine headaches, and migrainous symptoms such as phonophobia and photophobia.

    "1799": "Hello, Thanks for approaching Chat Doctor for your health care concern.  As per your query it seems that you are suffering from acne and acne scars, I would like to inform you that acne is a long term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. It is most common among teenagers.  It often appears on the face, neck, chest, back, and shoulders. Acne is not a serious health threat, but it can be a source of significant emotional distress.  Acne scars occur when the skin pores get inflamed or infected due to long term acne.  I would suggest you to follow the below mentioned tips for the treatment of acne scars-.  1- Use lemon juice-: Lemon juice is acidic and can help to gradually remove layers of dead skin, revealing newer, healthier skin underneath.  2- Use honey-: Honey is naturally antibacterial, so it's an ideal choice for acne treatment and prevention.  3- Aloe vera-: Aloe vera is toxic to the bacteria that cause acne. It can be used topically to treat the condition.  4- Use tea tree oil-: Tea tree oil is another essential oil that might be helpful in treating acne.  5- Use cucumber-: Cucumbers are often used to soothe the eyes, but they can also help to treat and prevent acne.  6- Drink plenty of water-: Drinking water helps keep your skin hydrated and flush out toxins from your body.  7- Eat a healthy diet-: Eating a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables can help keep your body healthy and your skin clear.  8- Get plenty of sleep-: Sleep is important for overall health and can help to prevent acne.  9- Reduce stress-: Stress can cause acne, so finding ways to manage stress is important.  10- Exercise regularly-: Exercise is good for overall health and can help to prevent acne by improving circulation and reducing stress.  Apart from this I would also suggest you to consult a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment of your acne scars as he/she can guide you better after examining your skin condition physically.",
