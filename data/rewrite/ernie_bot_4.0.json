Your brother has been diagnosed with throat cancer and is currently receiving treatment at the ENT section of Johannesburg General Hospital. I'm sorry to hear that he is in terrible pain and not receiving adequate medication. The treatment options for throat cancer depend on the stage of cancer.

    "3": "Hi, thank you for providing a brief history of yourself. The muscle cramps you mentioned could be related to diabetes, as some people report similar symptoms. A better assessment can be made depending on the duration of your diabetes history. Additionally, are you performing any regular exercises to control your blood glucose levels? If not, exercise is essential for diabetics, not just walking. Diabetes can cause nerve and muscle damage, leading to abnormal cellular metabolism and muscle cramps. You should also consider getting an MRI scan to check your lumbar spine and rule out any degenerative disc pathology, as cramps are possible with this condition too. Treatment will be guided based on the diagnosis. In both cases, exercises are recommended for better cellular function and metabolism. Regards, Jay in Chat Doctor.",

However, your treating doctor may suggest additional tests, such as a 2D echo, to rule out any other potential cardiac issues.\n\nRegarding the burning sensation in your chest, you may want to avoid consuming oily and spicy foods. If you smoke, quitting smoking is also recommended as part of your treatment for panic disorder. Your doctor may also prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, such as pantoprazole, to help alleviate the burning sensation in your chest.\n\nPlease feel free to ask any further questions, and I wish you the best of health.",

It is important for you to visit an oral physician, preferably a periodontist, so that they can assess the severity of your condition and provide appropriate treatment.

It is normal for infants to lose a few pounds around the age of one when they become mobile and start expending more energy.

During the follow-up appointment, your doctor may have adjusted the dose based on your diastolic blood pressure and decided to manage it with only one medication.

    "26": "Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query regarding severe asthma. I can understand your concern. Dear, any health problem you face does not happen all of a sudden but is the outcome of your faulty lifestyle and food habits for a long time, which weakens your immune system. Although many people with asthma rely on medications to prevent and relieve symptoms, you can do several things on your own to maintain your health and lessen the possibility of asthma attacks by detoxifying, following a diet, and increasing your activity level through yoga, Pranayama (deep breathing), and meditation. Regular exercise can strengthen your heart and lungs, which helps relieve asthma symptoms. Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables may increase lung function and reduce asthma symptoms. These foods, such as ginger, garlic, turmeric powder, and black pepper, are rich in protective nutrients (antioxidants) that boost the immune system. You should avoid allergens in your diet, such as very oily food, dairy products, or ice cream, which you feel give you problems. Overeating is always bad. Drink warm salt water. Avoid constipation, sleeplessness, stress, tea, coffee, smoking, and alcohol. Water intake is very essential. It is advised to see your doctor for further guidance. Hope this helps solve your query. Take care and all the best. Don't hesitate to get back if you have any further questions.",

I can understand how worried you must be feeling, but let's try to address your health issues one by one.\n\nBased on your description, it seems like you're suffering from chronic bronchitis with pleuritic pain in the left chest that wraps around the left shoulder blade. The pain is likely caused by chronic bronchitis with clogged up terminal alveolar groups, leading to pleural inflammation from infection. An X-ray of your chest might show some dense shadows with thickened pleura, indicating edematous thickened inflamed pleura.\n\nThe fact that your cough is producing yellow mucus suggests the presence of infection in the air track. While pneumonia is a possibility, the absence of high fever with chills indicates that you might be recovering from bronchitis with pleuritic pain in the left chest laterally and in the back near the left shoulder blades.\n\nExhaustion is a common symptom of chronic infection, but it could also suggest TB bronchitis with pleuritic pain. To investigate this further, you could consider getting an AFB sputum/PCR test of the yellow mucus to detect TB antigen or live/dead bacteria. An IGRA blood test could also help detect hidden subclinical TB.\n\nIn the meantime, taking a course of Augmenting duo (Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid) might help differentiate non-TB causes if it shows improvement within 10 days. Additionally, supporting your body with a high protein bland diet, plenty of fluids, and vitamins could help you recover sooner.\n\nFeel free to ask any further questions or seek clarification on any points. I hope this information helps you plan your further treatment with your healthcare provider. Wishing you a speedy recovery!",

If it is causing severe problems and infertility, you can consult your doctor for surgery. Good luck.",
    "75": "Hello, the duration of your sister's symptoms and the timeline for improvement will depend on a variety of factors, including the severity of her nerve damage and the effectiveness of her treatment. It's difficult to predict an exact timeline without a thorough examination by a neurologist.\n\nIn terms of therapy to help her learn to walk again, a physical therapist can develop a customized plan based on her specific needs and limitations. Her family can support her by encouraging her to participate in therapy sessions and helping her practice exercises at home. Additionally, providing emotional support and creating a positive environment can aid in her recovery.\n\nAs for dietary recommendations, ensuring she consumes a balanced diet rich in green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, and protein can aid in her recovery. Juices made from palatable vegetables like tomato, carrot, and beetroot can also be beneficial. Vitamin B1, B6, and B12 injections may be prescribed by a neurologist for 10 consecutive days to facilitate nerve recovery. It's important to monitor her for anemia and address any nutritional deficiencies. Thank you.",
    "76": "Fire ant bites inject formalin and certain other chemicals that can cause local damage to the tissue, resulting in pain and potentially an allergic reaction. The shot administered by the doctor likely addressed the allergic component, but the pain may still persist and be causing difficulty walking. I recommend giving the patient an anti-allergic medication such as levocetirizine for a few days and applying an emollient to the affected area. The patient should start to feel better within a week or so.",
    "77": "Thank you for your inquiry. I have reviewed your case and understand your concerns about the financial aspect of treating your tooth with a root canal and crown. However, it is important to note that the first molar plays a crucial role in chewing and occlusion, and its removal could significantly impact your ability to eat properly. If the tooth has adequate bone support, it is advisable to try and save it by undergoing root canal treatment to clear the infection. Once your financial situation improves, you can proceed with placing a crown on the tooth. Keep in mind that since you do not have any teeth behind the first molar, fixed appliances may not be a viable option in the future. Therefore, it is in your best interest to try and preserve the tooth. I hope this information helps you make an informed decision about your treatment. Take care.",
    "78": "Hello, I can understand your concern about skin exfoliation. Please check the exact reason for exfoliation as it can be due to a variety of reasons. For my patients, I combine petroleum and other oils as emollients with urea as a keratolytic cream. Petroleum and other oils are easily available over the counter. I advise my patients to apply any of these just after bathing when the skin is still wet. It preserves the moisture in the body and therefore reduces flaking. When applying any of the creams later, you should first give compressions of mildly warm water or take a shower and then apply it. Avoid using any strong soaps or detergents on the skin. Wear simple, loose cotton clothes and avoid synthetic clothes. Best wishes.",
    "79": "Hi, I understand your concern after reading your question. You don't need to worry about contracting diabetes from the needle prick injury as diabetes is not a blood-borne disease. The transmission of diabetes is not possible through this means. Diabetes is a hormonal disorder caused by impaired insulin function, and a positive family history increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, it is important to be cautious when dealing with blood-related situations, such as injections and shaving, as blood-borne diseases like Hepatitis B and AIDS can be transmitted from an infected person. But in your case, as you only experienced a small prick and a small drop of blood, there is no need for concern. I hope this addresses your question. If you have any further concerns, please feel free to ask. Take care.",
    "80": "Depending on your age, occupation, and physical habits, lower back pain can have different causes. The pain on the left side of your lower back may not be related to the medications you are taking. However, it is still recommended to get kidney function tests done to rule out any side effects. If the pain is caused by movement of the back, bending, or twisting, and you can feel tender points in the lower back area, then it may be isolated back pain. In the meantime, you can take 400mg of ibuprofen twice a day after meals, apply hot fomentation, and avoid any strain on your back.",

It could also be dilated salivary ducts due to congenital abnormalities or obstruction. 3.

Only after that can I further suggest a treatment. 5. If you have already had an ultrasound, that is okay, or else ask your doctor to assist you with that. I hope this helps.

In addition, a low-salt diet is recommended for its treatment. If the ascites is not decreasing, therapeutic paracentesis, which means its removal, can be done. I also suggest getting your fluid examined as ascites may be due to metastasis besides liver disease. In the meantime, follow a low-fat diet and consume more fruits and green leafy vegetables. Avoid refined sugar and processed food. Taking papaya seeds with lemon juice daily is a good herbal remedy. I wish your father good health.",

    "85": "Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor. If your period is normally regular, then it is possible that you have conceived. However, since you used a condom, the chances of pregnancy are very low. Blood tests should be able to determine if you are pregnant or not. If the urine pregnancy tests were done before day 11 to 14 after possible conception, they may be falsely negative. If the tests are truly negative, then other tests would be needed to determine the reason for the delay. Possible causes could be polycystic ovarian syndrome or other hormonal imbalances. I hope this helps.",
    "86": "Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are experiencing blunt chest trauma due to a punch to the chest area. You are mostly experiencing musculoskeletal pain as you are not having any breathing difficulties. Therefore, avoid heavy lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements that cause pain and avoid sleeping in bad postures. Take painkillers and muscle relaxants as prescribed by Chat Doctor and apply a warm water pad to the affected area. With this treatment, you will most likely improve within 1-2 weeks. If there is no improvement, get a chest X-ray done to rule out rib fractures and internal lung damage. I hope I have answered your question. Wish you good health. Thank you.",
    "88": "Hi, I'm sorry to hear about your recent health issues. First, let me clarify that kidney infections do not cause hemorrhoids; they are two separate conditions that you may have noticed simultaneously. The bumps you are developing are likely perianal and could be caused by hemorrhoids.\n\nTo alleviate your symptoms, I recommend using stool softeners, increasing your fiber intake, and drinking plenty of fluids. You could also try sitting in a warm bath to relieve discomfort. I don't think wearing thongs is causing your hemorrhoids, but it's best to avoid wearing them until your symptoms improve. Once your hemorrhoids settle, you can continue wearing thongs if you wish.\n\nI hope this information is helpful and relevant to your situation. Best of luck, and get well soon!",
    "89": "Hi, thanks for your question and for providing a detailed history of your symptoms. Based on the information you have provided, I would advise the following: seek the opinion of a neurologist for confirmation of your condition. An MRI of the thoracic spine may be necessary to determine if there is any compression of the spinal discs or other entrapment issues. Additionally, it would be important to determine if there is any history of herpes zoster (shingles) as post-herpetic neuralgia can be a common cause of this type of pain. In terms of treatment, a trial of gabapentin may be effective, which will both help diagnose and treat your condition. If there is a protruding disc identified, a more formal discectomy may be necessary. Take care and make sure to thoroughly investigate and treat your condition accordingly.",
    "90": "Hello, Thank you for bringing your concern to Chat Doctor. Your observation that asthma symptoms worsen before your period is accurate. During this time, there is a decrease in progesterone and estrogen levels in your body. These hormonal changes can exacerbate asthma symptoms in some individuals, although the relationship between hormones and asthma is complex and not fully understood. Asthma typically requires two types of medication: a controller or preventer, usually in the form of inhaled steroids, and a reliever, which is a short-acting beta 2 stimulant also inhaled. If the steroid inhaler alone is not sufficient to prevent attacks, a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) may be added. I recommend discussing your current medications with your doctor or providing me with that information so I can offer more specific advice on reducing your attacks. Take care.",

The material typically used for dental crowns is an alloy containing nickel, cobalt, and chromium. In rare cases where aluminum is used, it is not considered standard practice. Even in pediatric dentistry, aluminum crowns are seldom used, and stainless steel crowns or similar alloys are preferred.\n\nI recommend having your crown replaced by a trustworthy dentist who can fabricate it using the appropriate material for long-lasting results and to avoid any potential adverse effects on your dental tissues, both soft and hard.

I recommend that you get an MRI to investigate further. In the meantime, you can take analgesic and neurotrophic medication to manage the symptoms. Avoid lifting weights and sit with support to alleviate discomfort. Consulting a physiotherapist may also be helpful, as they can provide treatments such as ultrasound and inferential therapy to quickly relieve symptoms.

    "97": "Hello! Thank you for your question. The symptoms you described do not sound like cancer. Bad smelly stools can be caused by pancreatic disease, IBS, or diet. Severe right lower abdominal pain can be caused by ovarian cysts or inflammation of the urinary tract. I suggest you have some tests: abdominal ultrasound, urinalysis, full blood work with liver and pancreas tests, stool tests, and transvaginal ultrasound. And you should definitely have a colonoscopy repeated (it is advisable to have a colonoscopy repeated after 5 years of small polyp removal). If all tests are negative, you may have IBS. Therefore, Rifaximin 400 mg 3x1 for 7 days and Mebeverine 200 mg once a day may be helpful (should be prescribed by your doctor). I hope this helps. Regards.",

It's best to consult a pulmonologist and get a clinical examination of your respiratory system, including a chest x-ray and a pulmonary function test (PFT). The chest x-ray will help rule out any lung infections, while the PFT will help diagnose bronchitis. If all of these tests come back normal, then there is likely no major illness to worry about. Stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms, so it's important to try and relax and avoid stress and tension. I hope this helps and wish you good health.",
    "100": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your question. Both Phenytoin (Eptoin) and Levetiracetam (Levipil) are anti-epileptic medications, which means they are given to control seizures. Now, you have not provided details as to why the doctors wanted to switch from Phenytoin to Levetiracetam. It could be that the seizures may not have been well controlled by Phenytoin, thus requiring a change of medication. Without any information about how well controlled her symptoms are, it is not possible to give any definitive advice on further treatment options. So, I would suggest that you ask your doctor why the medication had to be changed and whether it would be sufficient if she only takes one medication. It is not true that these medications are bad for the brain, but it is also important that the appropriate medication in the right doses are given in order to control the symptoms. I wish you all the best.",

To help with the stomach pain, you can give him a Genus tablet to chew on now, and another one to keep in his mouth like a chocolate. The fever itself is not as important as your son's activity level when he is not feverish. If he is active and playing when he doesn't have a fever, then it is probably just a viral illness and he doesn't need antibiotics. Viral fevers can last for 4-7 days, so don't worry too much about the duration if your son is still active. Best regards.",

The chest X-ray and ECG results being normal rule out any cardiac issues. It's important to rule out other possible causes of your chest and back pain before starting any treatment. I recommend consulting a family doctor or a surgeon to investigate further. Additionally, check for any acid reflux symptoms that could be causing your chest and back pain.

    "109": "Dear, thank you for consulting with me. I understand your concerns about your daughter's snoring. Snoring can be a common issue in children, and often there is no underlying medical condition causing it. However, it's still important to address the issue and try to find ways to help your daughter sleep more comfortably.\n\nThe ENT specialist you consulted may have given your daughter antibiotics to rule out any infection that could be contributing to the snoring. However, if the snoring persists and the specialist has confirmed that there are no physical abnormalities, then there are a few things you can try at home to help alleviate the issue.\n\nFirstly, changing your daughter's sleep position may help. If she sleeps on her back, try encouraging her to sleep on her side instead. This can help reduce the amount of blockage in her airway and decrease the snoring.\n\nSecondly, you can help open up your daughter's nasal passages before bed by using a saline nasal spray or a humidifier in her room. This can help reduce any congestion or blockage in her nose that may be contributing to the snoring.\n\nThirdly, changing your daughter's pillow or rearranging the height of her pillows may also help. If her pillow is too high or too soft, it can cause her head to tilt backwards and block her airway. Try using a firmer pillow or adjusting the height of her pillows to keep her head in a neutral position while she sleeps.\n\nLastly, making sure your daughter is well-rested and has a regular sleep schedule can also help reduce snoring. Tiredness and irregular sleep patterns can contribute to snoring, so establishing a consistent bedtime routine can help alleviate the issue.\n\nI hope these tips help you and your daughter find a solution to the snoring problem. If you have any further concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to ask.",

I understand that your concern is whether you should try for natural conception or IVF after your third miscarriage. My answer is that you can try for natural conception. Since you have conceived naturally twice, there is a high chance of conception by natural methods.\n\nRegarding your miscarriages, most of the time, they occur due to chromosomal or genetic abnormalities in the embryo, infections in the mother, or sometimes they are unexplained. However, don't lose hope and keep patience. You can get pregnant with natural methods.\n\nIf you are within the reproductive age group (women from 15-45 years) and have regular menses, then the chances of getting pregnant are even higher.

Azelaic acid is a natural product obtained from cereals and is a safe alternative for babies. Additionally, make sure to apply sunscreen when going outside to protect your baby's skin from harmful sun exposure, which can cause further damage.\n\nIt's also a good idea to exfoliate your baby's skin once a week to remove dead skin cells and promote healthier-looking skin. If you notice no improvement after one month of following these steps, I suggest consulting a dermatologist who may recommend antibiotic creams or antioxidant-based products that are safe for babies' skin.\n\nI hope this advice addresses your concerns, and I wish you and your baby the best of health.

These types of infections can cause lower abdominal bloating, discharges, and bleeding or blistering on the genitals. Additionally, stress can also cause some of these symptoms to appear. It is important that you seek medical attention to properly diagnose and treat your symptoms. I recommend that you schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider as soon as possible. They will likely take a swab of the discharge for analysis and prescribe appropriate treatment, which may include a course of antibiotics. I hope this information helps and please do not hesitate to ask any further questions. Take care.",
    "139": "Doctor's response: Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. I understand your concern about the increased hair loss while using Mintop 5. However, please note that one month is a short period to observe any significant improvement. The increase in hair fall might be due to the reason that Minoxidil, the active ingredient in Mintop 5, shifts hair follicles from the resting phase to the growth phase. This results in new hair growth, which pushes out the resting hair, leading to increased shedding. This is actually a positive sign indicating that the treatment is working.\n\nThis increased shedding usually reduces within 2-4 weeks. In addition to using topical Minoxidil, I suggest incorporating an oral anti-androgen medication into your treatment regimen for better results. As for using hair oil, you can certainly use almond oil or any other hair oil that suits your scalp condition. It is advisable to apply the oil after using Mintop 5 to avoid any interference with the medication's effectiveness.",
    "140": "Dear patient, You have injured your chest cage due to a fall. This needs to be investigated with an X-ray of the chest in the posteroanterior view to rule out any fractures. Visit a radiology center nearby and get it done. Apply a rib belt on your chest for one month. Continue taking ibuprofen 400mg thrice a day for pain relief. You can take cyclobenzaprine for back pain, but it has significant side effects and should be avoided. If the X-ray shows a fracture, you need to consult an expert orthopedic surgeon. All the best.",

There may be some underlying causes such as anemia, vitamin and nutritional deficiencies, thyroid dysfunction, stress, anxiety, worries, traveling, or any other internal disease. Poor hygiene and poor nutrition may also contribute to halogen effluvium. I suggest consulting a dermatologist for a proper diagnosis. To control hair fall and improve hair growth, you may take biotin 10 tabs daily for a few months and apply a mild steroid lotion on your scalp at night daily. Use herbal preparations for hair oiling and shampoo. You may need to undergo treatment for a few years, so please be patient for good results. I hope this helps you. Thanks.",
    "143": "Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Thanks for reaching out to us. You mentioned that you had cryptorchidism as a child and underwent surgery for it. Cryptorchidism is a congenital condition where the testicle remains in the abdomen instead of descending into the scrotal sac. During the surgery, there is a risk of herniation of the intestine or mesentery into the scrotal sac. If the sutures from the operation are visible, it's likely that they used unabsorbable sutures to close the internal incisions. I recommend consulting a surgeon for further diagnosis and treatment. Wishing you a speedy and full recovery. Best regards.",
    "144": "Answer e) is correct. During active stretch excitation of gamma efferent neutrons in the anterior gray column of the spinal cord, contraction of the polar regions of the introfugal fibers occurs, resulting in active stretching of the non-contractile equatorial regions of the nuclear bag and chain fibers. This leads to excitation of alpha motor neurons through the monosynaptic loop of the stretch reflex, resulting in contraction of the extrafugal fibers of the corresponding muscle until it shortens to match the degree of contraction of the muscle spindle. This method of skeletal muscle contraction maintains its residual length. The alpha and gamma motor neurons are excited simultaneously by the pyramidal tract, with the alpha neurons, being the fast conductors, initiating muscle contraction without limit of shortening, while the gamma neurons, through the reflex loop, maintain muscle contraction at the desired length.",
    "146": "Your child may be suffering from a viral infection that can present with the symptoms you mentioned. These infections usually last for 5-7 days, even with antibiotic treatment. The medications you are giving your child are appropriate. Over-the-counter pain relievers (analgesics) and fever reducers (antipyretics) can help relieve headaches, body aches, and fever. Available options include aspirin, Tylenol, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Gargling with warm water can also provide relief. You may consider adding lozenges. Please be patient as the condition should resolve soon. I hope this helps.",

Thanks for using Chat Doctor and I wish you the best of health.",
    "151": "Hi, based on what you've described, it seems that your daughter is experiencing a viral infection. The combination of fever, rash, and diarrhea is commonly associated with a viral illness. There's usually no need to be concerned about the rash unless your daughter appears very sick. If she's still playful, then there's no immediate cause for worry. In terms of the diarrhea, you should only be concerned if there's blood in her stool, low urine output, abdominal distension, or green bilious vomiting. I recommend administering zinc supplements and ORS to prevent dehydration. Best regards.",
    "152": "The doctor advises that since your pain has worsened and is now affecting your back, it would be best to seek medical attention promptly. If the pain is severe and interfering with your daily activities, you may take painkillers such as ibugesic-plus or biozobid-plus. Additionally, you can take calcium supplements like tab shall or tab toscal-gem once daily, preferably in the afternoon. Applying a holdup or powerless gel locally can also provide relief. It is recommended to consult a physiotherapist and perform physiotherapy exercises as well. Sleeping on a plain surface is also beneficial for back pain. It is important to note that the doctor's recommendation is based on the information provided and it is advisable to seek further evaluation and management from a healthcare professional.",

While it may ultimately be a minor condition, it's best to err on the side of caution and seek medical attention early. Best wishes.",
    "155": "Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. The condition you have referred to is called Urticaria or hives. It's an allergic manifestation of the skin, where an allergen leads to the release of certain substances from your blood, leading to an itchy skin rash and swelling over soft tissues. Proper management of this condition requires a thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up. You may need to go for specific tests such as a patch test, food prick test, and IgE antibody levels, among others. In terms of treatment, the best approach is to avoid the allergen as much as possible. Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from your diet. I would also advise you to take various antihistamines for a long duration (at least 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids. For non-responding cases, there are many other treatment options available. I hope this information helps you in resolving your query. Thank you.",

Based on the WHO categories, since you were licked by a dog, it falls under Category II, which requires thorough wound washing and a minimum of three doses of antirabies vaccine. As you have already washed the wound thoroughly with an antibacterial gel, it should have washed off any rabies virus present in the wound. Regarding your concern about the vaginal fungal infection, it is not related to the dog lick. Rabies is a disease that is 100% fatal, but it is also 100% preventable with proper and adequate treatment. Thank you.",

Your symptoms, such as feeling gassy, rapid pulse rate, and mild shortness of breath, are commonly seen in cases of gastritis. The relief you feel when gas is released also supports this diagnosis. There is no need to worry, as this condition is common. To alleviate your symptoms, avoid stress and tension, and try to relax and stay calm. Additionally, steer clear of hot and spicy food, and opt for frequent small meals instead of large ones. You may consider taking proton pump inhibitors and prokinetics to manage your symptoms.",
    "162": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Nicotine contains deriphyllin, which is an oral bronchodilator that can be helpful in bronchitis and asthma. However, the best treatment for these diseases is inhaled treatment. As you are not taking inhaled treatment, you are not improving completely. Therefore, it is better to consult a pulmonologist and get a clinical examination of your respiratory system and a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) done. The PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis and asthma but also determine the severity of the disease, and treatment is based on severity. You will definitely improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, with all of these treatments, you will be alright. I hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions, I will be happy to help. Wishing you good health. Thanks.",

    "166": "Hi, Thank you for submitting your question. Based on your accident history, where one tooth is lost and three are chipped, I recommend getting an x-ray done to determine the appropriate treatment plan. If your teeth are non-vital or dead, and the x-ray shows sufficient bone support, a root canal procedure can be done for the chipped tooth, followed by a post and core build-up. If the tooth is infected at the roots, the chipped pieces should be removed, and a prosthetic bridge can be placed, supported by either an abutment tooth or an implant. These are all viable treatment options for you. I suggest consulting with your dentist to discuss these options in further detail. I hope this information helps. Best regards.",

    "171": "Hi, You both are very young and have only been trying for 3-4 months. Let nature take its course. A child is a gift from God, so be patient and wait for it. There is no need to burden yourselves with investigations or treatment at this point. However, if you are very anxious, you can get checked by a doctor. The husband can get a semen analysis done and the wife can get a tube patency test and SG/SGI done. If everything is normal, have sex daily or on alternate days from the end of the period until day 10 (day 1 is the first day of bleeding). This will help discard older sperm. Have 2-3 days of abstinence and then have sex daily, as many times as you like, for 4-5 days, which is when ovulation occurs. Sperm can live for 3 days and an egg for 1 day. This will increase the chances of the egg meeting healthy, young sperm and increasing the chances of pregnancy. There is no special food that will increase the chances of pregnancy, but it is recommended to avoid foods that can lead to obesity. Best of luck!",

Your doctor can determine the appropriate treatment based on the results of these tests. Additionally, I suggest consulting with a hematologist and conducting further blood tests to investigate potential hematologic disorders. These additional tests may include blood ferritin and hemosiderine levels, vitamin B12 levels, among others. I hope this information is helpful.

This is generally an age-related developmental finding and typically does not require any treatment. It may only require follow-up ultrasounds, and surgical intervention may be necessary if there is pain, infection, or an increase in size. Currently, I recommend only follow-up ultrasounds, as this is usually not a serious finding.

I understand that this must be a difficult time for your family, especially considering your uncle's unmarried status and financial constraints.\n\nThe first step in determining the best course of action for your uncle is to ascertain the stage of his cancer. If the cancer is in stage 1 or 2, there is a good chance of complete recovery and cure. However, if the cancer has progressed to stage 3 or 4, your uncle may require chemotherapy and radiation therapy to extend his survival.\n\nUnfortunately, cancer treatment can be expensive, and the cost of medicines, investigations, and surgery can add up quickly. I suggest exploring options with cancer societies and inquiring at the Adyar Cancer Institute about the possibility of enrolling your uncle in a clinical trial. These trials often provide free investigations as part of their protocol.\n\nPlease do not lose hope, and remember that there are resources available to help your uncle through this difficult time.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",

In most types of neuropathic pain, all signs of the original injury are usually gone, and the pain one feels is unrelated to an observable injury or condition. With this type of pain, certain nerves continue to send pain messages to the brain even though there is no ongoing tissue damage. Neuropathic pain (also called nerve pain or neuropathy) is very different from pain caused by an underlying injury. While it is not completely understood, it is thought that injury to the sensory or motor nerves in the peripheral nervous system can potentially cause neuropathy. Neuropathic pain could be placed in the chronic pain category, but it has a different feel than chronic pain of a musculoskeletal nature. If you have stone-related colic pain, you can take a dicyclomine paracetamol combination.",

    "207": "Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to know more about you, such as your age, your symptoms in detail, your environment, your habits, and any other medical conditions you may have. However, based on the information you have provided, I would like to make the following suggestions:\n\n1. Asthma and COPD are different types of disorders, and it is important to distinguish between the two in order to choose the most appropriate treatment. Spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing can help to differentiate between the two.\n2. If you have asthma, I would recommend allergy testing to identify common airborne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, pollen, insect proteins, and animal dander. This will not only help to identify the allergens but also to determine the measures you can take to avoid them.\n3. Based on the results of the allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe allergen-specific immunotherapy which works on the immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms over a long period of time.\n4. In general, it is important to avoid exposure to dust, smoke, and air pollution as much as possible.\n5. Some inhalers can improve both asthma and COPD symptoms, but a proper diagnosis and spirometry will help your doctor to choose the most appropriate inhaler for you.\n\nRegarding your question about Montek LC, I am not familiar with this medication and would need more information about it. It is always advisable to consult with your doctor before starting any new medication, especially if you have a chronic condition such as asthma or COPD. Your doctor will be able to advise you on the safety and efficacy of Montek LC and whether it can be taken long-term.",

    "215": "Hello, thank you for contacting Chat Doctor. Normally, the heart has a regular systole and diastole phase, with regular contraction and relaxation of the heart chambers. This results in a normal heart rhythm. However, if there is a disturbance in the heart rhythm, it is called arrhythmia, and the heart beats irregularly. For a precise diagnosis of the type of arrhythmia, such as premature ventricular contraction, atrial arrhythmia, or ventricular arrhythmia, a Holter monitor is worn for 24 hours. An ECG and Echo are also useful diagnostic tools. Treatment is given according to the cause, such as beta-blockers. Your blood pressure should also be checked. Please consult a cardiologist for further evaluation and treatment. I hope this addresses your concern. Take care.",
    "219": "Hi, welcome to our site. I am Chat Doctor. I have read your query and understand your concern. I want you to know that you are not alone and there is no need to feel ashamed or depressed. I will try my best to help you.\n\nFirstly, I suggest that you continue to seek medical attention and treatment for your mania disease. It is important to follow the prescribed medication regimen to manage your symptoms effectively.\n\nSecondly, I understand that you are struggling with addiction and the urge to masturbate frequently. This can be a difficult habit to break, but it is important to try and overcome it in order to improve your mental and emotional well-being. Here are some strategies that you can try:\n\n1. Distract yourself: When you feel the urge to masturbate, try to divert your attention by engaging in some other activity such as going for a walk, meeting someone, having a bath, reading, listening to music, or pursuing a hobby.\n2. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend or family member about your struggles. They can offer you encouragement and help you stay motivated to overcome your addiction.\n3. Practice relaxation techniques: Try practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to reduce stress and anxiety. This can help you manage your urges more effectively.\n4. Seek professional help: Consider seeking the help of a mental health professional who can provide you with counseling and support to help you overcome your addiction.\n\nRemember that overcoming addiction takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and don't set unrealistic expectations. Try to focus on the progress you make each day and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem.

    "220": "Welcome to Chat Doctor. It seems that you are experiencing testicular dysfunction, where the testis is not functioning properly, resulting in no sperm production and a secondary increase in FSH levels. This condition is known as primary hypogonadism. I recommend that you consult a physician to have your testis examined and to have your testosterone levels checked, which are likely to be low. If you are seeking a solution to have a child, you may consider in vitro fertilization (IVF) with a sperm donor. Alternatively, adoption is also an option.",
    "222": "Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. I personally do not believe that young age is a specific contraindication for surgery. If your symptoms of back pain, along with shooting pain down the entire leg, are severe and not improving with conservative treatment methods, then surgery may be necessary. As all forms of conservative treatment have failed to provide you with pain relief, surgical decompression of the disc may be indicated. Endoscopic discectomy or microlumbar discectomy can provide promising pain relief with minimal morbidity. I hope this information is helpful and wish you the best of luck.",
    "223": "Hi there, thank you for using ChatDoctor. The black dot on your toenail is not a definitive sign of diabetes, so you shouldn't be too worried about it. It can appear due to multiple causes, such as trauma, bacterial or fungal infection, or in a very small percentage, it can be a sign of skin cancer. However, since you have noticed it and it hasn't changed in size, color, or there are no visible changes on your toenail, it seems to be harmless. If you're still concerned about it being a complication of diabetes and are feeling anxious, the best advice I can give you is to get a fasting blood sugar test. If the result is normal, try to relax and enjoy your life. I hope this answer is helpful. Kind regards.",
    "224": "Hello and welcome. Thank you for sharing your concern. The broken tooth should be addressed by a dental professional. It should be smoothed out using a dental instrument, and if necessary, a filling should be placed to merge the affected teeth. In addition, I recommend applying a local anesthetic such as Denote to the affected area 3-4 times a day. Take B-complex capsules for about 15 days, and this should help with the healing process. I hope this helps. Thank you and take care.",
    "225": "Hi, thanks for asking a question. Here, the first possibility to consider is allergic asthma if there is associated breathlessness with the cough. Secondly, it could be allergic acute bronchitis. Thirdly, eosinophils can also increase in parasitic infections. Filaria or ascaris-like worms can lead to hypersensitivity lung reactions. Albendazole is used for ascaris worms. For ruling out whether it is obstructive or restrictive lung disease, pulmonary function tests should be done. So, since your condition has recurred, it should be investigated to rule out the cause. Finally, green sputum can be a result of pseudomonas infection, which should also be ruled out if no other cause is found by sputum culture. I hope my suggestion will help you.",
    "226": "Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Smokers are prone to bronchospasm, and a common reason for this is acute bronchitis. With treatment, it usually takes almost 1-2 weeks to resolve bronchospasm. Quitting smoking should be a priority to speed up recovery and prevent further bronchospasm. After this episode resolves, get a PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) done to check your lung function and any abnormalities. If your PFT is normal, only smoking cessation is required. So wait for 1-2 weeks for this bronchospasm to resolve. I hope I have answered your question. Wishing you good health. Thank you.",

Based on your description of left-side stomach pain, which is sometimes sharp and sometimes dull, and accompanied by nausea and vomiting, there are several possibilities that could be causing your symptoms. The first possibility is peptic ulcer disease or hiatal hernia. This can be diagnosed through an upper GI endoscopy. In addition to seeking medical attention, you can try raising the head of your bed by 4 inches with blocks and avoid eating before bed to help control stomach acid. It is also important for you to follow up on your post-delivery checkup as it has been six months since you delivered your baby. Additionally, not having any menstrual periods since delivery may be a concern and should be discussed with your doctor.",

Based on the information provided, I recommend that you consult a pulmonologist for your mother and have the following tests done:\n\n1. Chest X-ray to rule out lower respiratory tract infection (pneumonia).\n2. Pulmonary function test (PFT) to rule out chronic bronchitis.\n3. CT thorax if needed, to rule out pulmonary fibrosis if the X-ray is inconclusive.\n\nIt is important to properly diagnose your mother before starting any treatment. Giving haphazard treatment without a proper diagnosis may not help her condition. Therefore, I advise that you consult a pulmonologist and follow their recommended course of action for diagnosis and treatment.",
    "232": "Hello, thanks for writing to us. It doesn't look like you have lost the blood clot, rather the red spot at the extraction site is the blood clot itself. Initially, the blood clot will appear as a red substance filling the extraction socket. Gradually, it will turn into yellowish and whitish healing tissue that will help fill and completely heal the extraction site. So as of now, it appears to be a blood clot. If you have any doubts, you can have a clinical examination done by your dentist. Right now, follow the post-extraction instructions as advised by your dentist, avoid forceful spitting, do not suck anything through a straw, do not smoke, eat a soft diet, and use gentle swishing to clean your mouth.

Incontinence of urine after TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is usually due to one of the following factors: 1) Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), 2) Uncontrolled Diabetes, or 3) Thermal Injury to the sphincter of the urethra which controls urination. To help manage this issue, I recommend the following measures: 1) Ensuring that your father's diabetes is well-controlled, 2) Getting a urine culture done to determine the appropriate antibiotic to control the UTI, 3) Consulting with a doctor through the chat feature, and 4) Performing perineal exercises to strengthen the urethral sphincter.

I strongly advise you to seek a diagnosis and discussion of treatment options with your doctor as soon as possible. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask and I will do my best to assist you.",
    "237": "Hi, thanks for your question. Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine the cause of the lump under your nephew's skin. However, the fact that your nephew is otherwise healthy and has an upcoming CT scan is a positive sign. The CT scan will provide more information about the lump and help guide further treatment. In general, lumps and bumps under the skin can be caused by a variety of things, including cysts, abscesses, and tumors. While it's natural to be concerned, try to stay calm and wait for the results of the CT scan before jumping to any conclusions. I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any other questions.",
    "238": "Hi, If you have started jogging after a long break, you should prepare your body. Don't start directly with 4 km. Start with 1.5 km for a week, and gradually increase your distance over a period of 2-3 weeks. What has happened is that because your muscles require continuous oxygen during such sudden, strenuous exercise, and your body is unable to supply it, it switches to anaerobic mode of energy production (where oxygen is not needed). This is like taking a detour from the usual path. The problem here is that due to this alternate mode, a lot of lactic acid is produced in the body as a by-product and gets stored in your muscles. This causes pain, as lactic acid is released from your muscles very slowly. Your back muscles have gone into a spasm. Apply some heat, rest from jogging for 2-3 days or until the pain subsides. Then start slowly. Don't worry, you'll get back to your 4 km run slowly, although a bit slower. Best of luck!",
    "239": "Hi, thanks for contacting Chat Doctor. I have noted that your CT scan showed a large liver mass. It is true that hormones can affect the liver and can lead to conditions similar to hepatitis. However, as a large mass has been discovered, it needs to be investigated further. Mostly, a triple phase CT or MRI with AFP estimation can rule out malignancy. But if you need a detailed evaluation, then USG or CT-guided biopsy or FNAC can be done. Treatment will be given according to the cause. If it is a non-malignant bacterial infection, antibiotics will be given. Meanwhile, you should have a low-fat diet and eat more fruits. For fever, you can take paracetamol. If needed, a full spectrum and detailed gynecological workup can also be done. For the liver mass, it is recommended to consult a gastroenterologist. I hope my suggestion will be helpful. Take care. Chat Doctor.",

It's great to hear that you've found a way to manage your pain without resorting to opioid medication and that you've been pain-free for the past two years. However, lumbar spinal stenosis is a chronic and progressive disorder, and it's difficult to predict if or when the pain will return.\n\nI recommend that you continue with your current physical regimen, avoiding any heavy lifting and trying to lose some weight if you're overweight. If you experience any difficulty walking, it may be a good idea to get a new MRI of your lumbar spine to check on the status of your condition.\n\nI hope this answer is helpful to you, and I wish you the best of luck with managing your lumbar spinal stenosis.",
    "241": "Hello Frank, Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. The discomfort and rumbling sensation in your lower right belly area, along with increased toilet visits, gas, and soft stool, could be indicating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

To rule out any serious conditions, I recommend you see a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation. They can perform a physical examination, including pressing on different belly areas, to determine the cause of your symptoms. If needed, they may also suggest further diagnostic tests.

    "244": "Hello there, Wheezing is caused by bronchoconstriction (obstruction of the smaller airway passages), which indicates hyper-responsiveness of the air passages. Management includes: 1. Inhalers such as Salbutamol and Formoterol - these provide symptomatic relief by causing bronchodilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction and increasing airflow to the lungs). 2. Montelukast preparations - used as maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma. 3. Antihistamines like Cetirizine and anti-tussive preparations can also be used to provide symptomatic relief from coughing. 4. Additionally, make sure you are well protected from exposure to cold, dust, or other allergens. If symptoms persist, please consult a pulmonologist for proper clinical evaluation. Wishing you good health. Take care.",

    "246": "Hello! This is a very common occurrence, so please don't worry about it! Quite often, I come across cases of post-injury bumps on people's bodies and learn something new each time: 1. These are old organized hematomas that often undergo calcification, causing the swelling to harden rather than disappear. 2. They can become infected if there is any kind of manipulation, resulting in an abscess. 3. Often, these bumps are forgotten until some complication arises. 4. There might be an underlying bone fracture that could lead to a re-fracture in the future. 5. Some antibiotics can cause the formation of lumps and pains on touch due to hardness. However, these bumps are never malignant or a sign of any serious disease! Therefore, if you are still worried, please consult a surgeon for a needle biopsy, x-ray, and confirmation. Regards.",
    "247": "Hello Aubrey,\n\nThank you for reaching out. As a spine surgeon, I can assist you with your first concern regarding the convex curve in your back.\n\nThe convex curve you described is known as kyphosis when it is in front of the back plane, while a side-to-side curve is called scoliosis. If your kyphosis is postural, which is common in adolescent girls and presents with stooped shoulders and a slouched trunk, it can be corrected through physical therapy and strengthening of your back muscles with posture training.\n\nHowever, if the kyphosis is structural, meaning the alignment of your vertebrae is fixed in a kyphotic position, it may require surgical correction. This is typically indicated if there is associated weakness in the legs or difficulty walking and is not purely for cosmetic reasons. To determine whether you have postural or structural kyphosis, an X-ray of your spine would be necessary.\n\nIn summary, it is likely that you have postural kyphosis. I recommend consulting with a skilled physical therapist who can guide you through appropriate exercises and therapy to address this issue.\n\nRegarding your second problem of a permanently blocked nose, facial swelling, and small-appearing eyes, I suggest consulting an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) or an allergist/immunologist who can better address these symptoms as they fall outside my area of expertise. They will be able to provide you with more specific advice and treatment options tailored to your individual situation.\n\nWishing you the best of health,\n\n[Your Name]",

Have you ever felt any pain or heaviness in your chest while walking that relieved with rest? I recommend that you go for an ECG test, which is a basic diagnostic tool.

You can also apply a combination of creams containing a steroid and triple antibiotic ointment to aid in the healing process. Additionally, cool compresses can help reduce inflammation.

    "275": "It seems like you are experiencing symptoms of cervical spondylosis or cervical disc disease. The intervertebral disc spaces in the cervical spine region may have reduced due to various reasons, leading to compression of the nerves emanating from these areas. This compression can cause numbness in the arms and hands. To manage your symptoms, I recommend using a cervical collar support, traction, and yoga neck exercises to strengthen your neck muscles and maintain proper gaps between the vertebrae. Osteophytes, or cartilaginous growths on intervertebral joints, can also put pressure on the nerves. Avoid exercising when you experience pain. For medication, you can try hot water baths and hot fomentation. You can also take herbal Ayurvedic medicines like Tab. Rumply forte and Cap Shirt, which are safe to use. Adding one teaspoon of turmeric to warm water or milk can also provide natural anti-inflammatory benefits.

From your question, I understand that you have been diagnosed with Ureaplasma urealyticum and have started treatment, but your partner has not yet started treatment as you are currently in different countries.

Observe the results, and if there is no improvement, you should move to the next step, which is nasal steroid sprays. You should start using the steroid nasal spray 3-4 weeks before your symptoms start. This can give very good results. If these sprays do not work, then you should undergo an allergy test. An immunologist will perform a skin prick test to determine what substances you are allergic to. Once identified, you will need to undergo immunotherapy. I can assure you that this will cure your allergy by up to 80-90%. Please see a physician who can prescribe antihistamine tablets and nasal sprays for you.

It's important for you to be cautious and avoid chocolates as much as possible. I recommend getting an absolute eosinophil count (AEC) test done, as the count will be raised in case of an allergic reaction. To manage your current symptoms, you can take Tab Monte LC, but keep in mind that this is only a temporary solution. Long-term, you should avoid chocolates to prevent these allergy symptoms from occurring.

    "294": "Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion, the brown discharge may not be related to the progesterone injection. There could be various causes for brown discharge such as thyroid abnormalities, progesterone insufficiency, bleeding from the cervix, abnormal pregnancy, or unknown causes. In fact, progesterone injections are given to stop spotting or bleeding caused by hormonal abnormalities. The rise in your ChatDoctor test results is also significant. The above causes should be ruled out by physical examination, thyroid profile, and ultrasound. Don't worry, as brown discharge does not always indicate a miscarriage. I suggest you consult a doctor and rule out the above causes through examination and necessary investigations. With appropriate treatment, it will subside. Avoid stress and physical exertion, get plenty of rest, and avoid intercourse. Continue with your medication as prescribed by your doctor. I hope this helps. Best regards.",
    "295": "Hello, dear. During the lactational phase, even though periods have started, they may be irregular, and so is egg release. Therefore, you cannot rely on safe periods. Even though he did not ejaculate in the vagina, usually pre-ejaculation secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum contains some sperm which can cause pregnancy. I would not give importance to the menstrual cramps. Maybe you will get your period in a few days. To determine the possibility of pregnancy, the best and quickest option for you is to have a beta hCG test on the blood 10 days after the incidence of unprotected sex. Alternatively, you may wait for 21 days after unprotected sex and perform a pregnancy test on the first morning urine sample; earlier tests may report false negative results. If you are not pregnant, you can take some progesterone preparation like medroxyprogesterone for 5 days or an estrogen + progesterone combination like ethinylestradiol/cyproterone for 2 days. 4-7 days later, you will get your period. If you are pregnant, you can terminate the pregnancy with medicines up to 9 weeks of gestation. For either option, you should see your gynecologist; do not take these medicines on your own.

I recommend that you consult an oral physician, who can take a radiograph to determine the amount of space available for the tooth to erupt. If there is not enough space for the tooth to erupt, then removal of the tooth may be necessary.

Some indicators of a viral infection include normal behavior between fever spikes, a runny nose, or associated diarrhea. In such cases, an antibiotic like azithromycin is typically not necessary. Instead, the focus should be on properly managing the fever and providing symptomatic relief while monitoring the child's symptoms. If you have started a course of azithromycin, it is recommended to complete at least 3 days of treatment. To help alleviate the cough, you can continue using levolin syrup along with homemade remedies like honey, ginger, warm water, or milk with turmeric to soothe the throat. For the cold, you can consider using antihistamines. If the child's condition worsens or does not improve within 2-3 days, it is advisable to seek medical attention from a pediatrician.",

They may recommend an MRI to check for internal bleeding at a later stage if you experience any abnormal symptoms. Swelling is a normal physiological response, and it usually subsides within 48-72 hours, but it may take slightly longer depending on age and other factors. Since you don't report any other symptoms, you can wait and apply ice to the area. If you notice any abnormal symptoms, it's best to visit the emergency room for a thorough examination.

In cases of unexplained infertility, the causes may be problems with sperm penetration and implantation, which cannot be diagnosed. I would suggest you try ovulation induction therapy. This will help multiple follicles to mature and rupture. In addition, I recommend trying GUI (intrauterine insemination) since you have been trying for 4 years. With GUI, the sperm are washed and processed, and healthy sperm are placed in the uterus. This avoids any problems with sperm ascent and helps with sperm penetration. You can try 3 to 4 cycles of GUI before considering further options. I hope this information is helpful. Best regards.",

    "327": "I understand your concerns and have gone through your details. The clear liquid that comes out after you urinate is most likely semen. Semen production is an automatic process in the body and it is produced when you are sexually aroused.

However, sometimes the body finds its own ways to dispose of the waste semen, which is through urine or nocturnal emission. This process is normal, natural, and involuntary, and you cannot control it. There is no health issue due to this, so please don't worry or be anxious.

It is important to follow up with further testing in three months to ensure that your symptoms have resolved and to rule out any underlying conditions that may be causing your symptoms.",
    "331": "Hi, thanks for your question. Based on your description, it seems that the enlarged bumps on the back of your tongue are likely due to swollen circumvallate papillae. These papillae are normally present on the back one-third of the tongue in a typical \"V\" shaped pattern and are slightly raised. However, if they are red, inflamed, and swollen, this is not normal and can be caused by a number of factors such as burning with hot foods and liquids, chemical injury from concentrated mouthwashes, allergic reactions to medicines, acid reflux, oral infections like thrush, or throat infections. Given that you recently had a viral infection and are also susceptible to yeast infections, both of these could be contributing to the swollen papillae. I recommend that you consult an oral physician for evaluation and treatment of the underlying cause.

    "334": "Hello, thank you for your question about your lumpy chin and lip. I am glad that you are taking steps to address the long-standing chin lump, while also feeling confident that the lip lump will resolve. In my opinion, I recommend seeking an orthopedic consultation and getting an X-ray of your chin to rule out any bone contusion or hairline fracture, as it has been three weeks and you still have the chin bump. Additionally, as you are concerned about the lumpy chin, I suggest taking some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as the contused tissue is not responding quickly to Arnica. Please stop using Arnica and instead, follow your doctor's advice on whether to take serrapeptiase enzymes. A bland, non-spicy, high-protein diet and cold compresses are also essential for the early recovery of these traumatic lumps. This change in medication should address your concerns about the chin lump. Please follow the advice of your emergency room doctor and modify your medications accordingly.

    "341": "Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Bleeding during early pregnancy can be common, and it's often caused by implantation bleeding, which occurs when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus. This usually happens around the time of the expected period. The fact that your pregnancy test levels are increasing is a good sign that the pregnancy is growing.\n\nYour gestational age is calculated from the first day of your last menstrual period, regardless of the length of your cycle. Based on this calculation, you would be approximately 5 weeks and 4 days pregnant.\n\nA pelvic ultrasound at this early stage of pregnancy would likely only show a gestational sac, which is a normal finding. At 6-7 weeks, the ultrasound should show a fetal pole and cardiac activity. This is what your doctor is expecting to see on the next scan, which will give a more accurate assessment of the gestational age and the health of the pregnancy.\n\nTry not to worry too much, as stress and anxiety can have a negative impact on pregnancy.

    "354": "Dear Sir/Madam,\n\nI have carefully reviewed your concern about your child's persistent cough. It appears that your child's immune system may be weak, which could be contributing to the recurrent cough. To address this issue, I recommend implementing several lifestyle changes that can have long-term benefits.\n\nFirstly, incorporating daily deep breathing exercises and yoga for 30 minutes can be beneficial. Additionally, ensuring your child engages in 20-30 minutes of walking in fresh air will aid in better oxygenation.\n\nTo prevent exacerbating the cough, it is essential to avoid exposing your child to excessive cold or environments with high pollen counts. Furthermore, prioritizing a nutritious diet rich in proteins, vitamins, and iron is crucial for immune system support.\n\nMaintaining your child's hygiene, including oral hygiene, is also important. Encouraging them to do salt water or peppermint gargles 2-3 times a day can help soothe the throat. Incorporating turmeric and tulsi (basil) into their diet in appropriate forms can also be beneficial.\n\nLastly, it is advisable to avoid giving your child excessive sweets, oily or spicy foods, and chilled water or cold drinks as these may aggravate the cough.\n\nPlease note that the suggested remedies are general guidelines and may not replace professional medical advice. If your child's symptoms persist or worsen, I recommend consulting a pediatrician for further evaluation and personalized treatment.",
    "355": "Hi, Thank you for reaching out. It is crucial to have a thorough understanding of the CT scan results. Certain conditions, such as cancer, can appear as lesions in the liver measuring 10 x 5 cm. However, this needs to be confirmed through tissue testing, which can be done via FNAC or biopsy. In these procedures, cells from the suspected tumor are extracted using a needle and examined under a microscope. Microscopic examination reveals the characteristics of cancer and whether it is present. Often, even with a large tumor in the liver, patients may appear normal externally. Even liver function tests can yield normal results, and the patient may be unaware of the condition. The liver is an organ that can regenerate its function, and it is possible that cells in the remaining part of the liver are functioning properly even with cancer.

    "356": "Welcome to Chat Doctor. Based on your description, the lump on the left side of your neck just below your jaw that does not move and is not obstructing your airway or affecting your ability to swallow could be a bony lesion (cystic/solid) if it is hard to the touch. If the lesion is soft, it could be submandibular sialadenitis (salivary ductal dilatation), a submandibular lesion, or lymph node enlargement. To get a better understanding of the lesion, a neck ultrasound would be helpful as it can characterize the lesion, its extension, and source. As for the dentures, they could be a contributing factor, but further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause. I hope this information helps you, and please do not hesitate to ask if you have any further questions. Wishing you good health. Thank you.",
    "357": "Hi, Thanks for your query. The pain under the left side of your rib cage could be caused by a few things. It could be due to Gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), in which case avoiding spicy and greasy food and taking proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole can help. A gastroscopy can aid in diagnosis. Another possibility is pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), in which case stopping smoking and alcohol, if applicable, and getting blood tests like serum amylase and lipase can help with diagnosis. Lastly, it could be due to kidney stones, which can be diagnosed through an X-ray of the PUB. Antispasmodics can help with the pain, and increasing water intake is advised. The treatment will depend on the size and location of the stone. I hope this information is helpful, and I'm happy to answer any further questions you may have. Take care.",

Plaster support above the knee or, in the meantime at home, crepe may help you. 3. You need medication to reduce swelling, a combination of analgesics like diclofenac, with paracetamol and antacids. 4. Most important of all, elevation of the limb on 2 pillows, with the ankle and toes raised, to help you reduce swelling. Consult your nearby orthopedic surgeon.",
    "360": "Hi, thanks for reaching out. The increase in testosterone levels could be due to the medication you are taking, specifically Diane 35. It is possible that this medication is causing a rise in testosterone levels. However, it is important to note that this rise is unlikely to be caused by the Chat Doctor.\n\nIn terms of your treatment options, you can continue with the prescribed medication as advised by your doctor. Additionally, once your hormone levels have normalized, you can also consider ovulation-enhancing medication like camphene. This can potentially increase your chances of pregnancy and decrease the effects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n\nContinuing with your current treatment plan should not cause any adverse effects.

    "361": "Hello there... Experiencing pain for the first three days after a tooth extraction is normal, so there is no need for concern. However, it is important to monitor the duration and intensity of the pain. If the pain has decreased since the day of the extraction, then it is likely just part of the healing process. However, if the pain intensity increases, that could be a cause for concern. If the pain persists for more than 4 days with increased intensity, it could indicate an infection or other issue, and you should consult your dental surgeon. It is unlikely that an infection would set in so quickly, especially if proper sterilization procedures were followed at the clinic. The abscess that your dentist mentioned should clear up with antibiotics and exposure to atmospheric oxygen.",

    "383": "Hello dear, The symptoms you described in your post can be attributed to acute exacerbation of asthma, which is caused by a bacterial infection. Asthma occurs due to bronchoconstriction, which means there is obstruction of the smaller airway passages, leading to decreased airflow to the lungs. To manage your son's symptoms, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Stalin and Aeroflot inhalers can provide symptomatic relief by causing bronchodilation, which means they dilate the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction and increasing airflow to the lungs. You can use these inhalers when your son is having an acute attack.\n2. To control his fever, you can give him an analgesic antipyretic preparation such as Cronin or eugenic syrup.\n3. Antihistamine preparations like Allegra and a cough expectorant syrup can provide symptomatic relief for your son's cough and other symptoms.\n4. Your son should also take a course of antibiotics to manage the secondary bacterial infection.\n5. Make sure he is getting adequate hydration by drinking enough water and other fluids.\n6. Additionally, ensure that your son is well protected from cold, dust, and other allergens that could trigger an asthma attack.\n\nIf there is no improvement in your son's symptoms, please consult his treating pediatrician or pulmonologist for further evaluation and management.

If it's still on the higher side on at least three occasions, then you should start medication. Some patients have high blood pressure in a hospital setting, so ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is the best way to diagnose it, meaning when you are at home and relaxed. In younger age groups, ACE inhibitors like Enalapril or Lisinopril are recommended. Calcium channel blockers are a second choice, such as Amlodipine. Lifestyle modifications can also help, such as exercise, diet, reducing salt and fat, reducing smoking, alcohol, anxiety, and stress. I hope this answer helps you. Wishing you good health.",

As per your description, it appears that your daughter is experiencing frequent nose bleeds, possibly triggered by swimming or other activities.\n\nWhile a walk-in clinic may be able to provide some assistance, I would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a pediatrician or an otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat specialist) as soon as possible.

    "427": "Hi, thanks for contacting Chat Doctor. I have noted that your nephew is suffering from jaundice with hepatosplenomegaly. It is important that you consult a pediatrician for further evaluation and management of his condition.\n\nInitially, hemolytic anemia should be ruled out by performing a peripheral smear examination with relic count and serum LDH. If necessary, blood electrophoresis can be done to rule out hemoglobinopathies. A detailed history is also crucial to exclude congenital hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nIf needed, a liver biopsy may be required to establish a definitive diagnosis. A complete liver function test (LFT) investigation, including liver enzymes and viral markers, should be done. If bilirubin levels are not controlled, further management will be necessary.\n\nPlease make sure to follow up with the recommended diagnostic procedures and consult a pediatrician for specialized care.",
    "432": "Hi, Thanks for posting on Chat Doctor. I'm sorry to hear about your injury. Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have injured a ligament or fractured your hip. I recommend that you get an MRI of your right hip to properly diagnose the issue. In the meantime, you can take analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications to help with the pain and inflammation. It's important to use a cold compress and rest your hip by avoiding any vigorous physical activities that could further aggravate the injury. I strongly advise you to visit an orthopedic doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment. Best of luck with your recovery.",
    "433": "Dear patient, Based on your description, it is unlikely that your symptoms are related to an intra-abdominal lesion, and are more likely caused by a skin disorder such as infection or allergy. The presence of fever or redness could indicate a skin infection. To further investigate your symptoms, I recommend starting with an ultrasound and possibly proceeding to a CT scan if needed. Additionally, we will check your inflammatory markers to rule out any internal inflammation. I hope this information helps and wish you a speedy recovery.",
    "434": "Thank you for following up. There is no need to worry about her height as it is currently accelerating due to improved social conditions. However, eating too many sweets can close the growth nuclei, so if you don't want her to grow too tall, she should avoid eating too many candies. As for your doctor's decision to continue observing her, that is his prerogative. I personally don't think it is necessary as she is developing normally. If she ends up being taller, so be it. It is possible that some of her ancestors were also tall. Best regards.",
    "435": "The doctor's response to the patient's question can be rewritten and translated into English as follows:\n\n\"I admire your positive outlook and congratulate you for your attitude. Based on what you have described, I suspect that you may be experiencing depression, which could be due to stress in your personal life. In this case, seeking help is important. My recommendation is a combination therapy of antidepressant medication and low-dose benzodiazepine. Additionally, engaging in relaxation exercises such as JPMR or deep breathing exercises can be beneficial. However, for these exercises, it is best to seek guidance from a psychiatrist or psychologist. I hope this information helps you.\"",
    "436": "Hello! Thank you for reaching out. The symptoms you are describing sound like they could be related to hallucinations, which are a type of functional condition. I recommend that you try to control your thoughts and forget about these sensations, as they are not actually happening in reality. If you continue to experience these symptoms, it may be helpful to get a CT scan of your brain to rule out any underlying issues. However, if the symptoms persist, I suggest seeing a psychiatrist for further evaluation and treatment. Take care and have a nice day!",
    "440": "Hello, thank you for your question. Based on the results of your TVS-HSG test, your uterus appears to be normal in size and position with a thin, intact endometrium. Your ovaries are also normal in size, but follicles (eggs) are only seen in the right ovary. The fallopian tubes appear to be open and not blocked. However, the major factor that may affect your ability to conceive is your age. At 45, the ovaries' capacity to produce eggs may be limited. To properly assess your ovarian reserve, it is recommended to have regular menstrual cycles and to get your AMH (Anti-Mullerian Hormone) levels checked. Additionally, it is important to have your partner's semen analysis report to determine his fertility status. It is recommended that you consult an infertility specialist in your area and actively pursue assisted reproductive technology (ART) options as time is of the essence in your case.",

Based on your history and description, it is more likely that you have an upper respiratory tract infection (URI - pharyngitis). In my opinion, your throat is inflamed and congested, which is causing your symptoms of sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and breathing. To help alleviate your symptoms, follow these steps: 1. Gargle with warm water 5-6 times a day. 2. Take a combination of levocetrizine and paracetamol twice a day. 3. Avoid oily and spicy foods, as well as hard-to-chew foods. 4. Also, take a broad-spectrum antibiotic like levofloxacin or azithromycin once a day after breakfast. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please seek medical attention immediately.",
    "442": "Hello, I have reviewed your question and understand your concern. The presence of fresh blood in the rectum may indicate hemorrhoids or a rectal mass.

Please have the prostate-specific antigen levels checked and discuss with his doctor whether he requires further chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Please do not worry.",
    "444": "We cannot diagnose solely based on medical history. Asthma can be caused by allergies, which can affect both the skin and respiratory system. Allergies can develop at any time, at any age, and with any substance. You can start by taking Forcan 150mg once a week for six weeks. Take Singulair 10mg twice a day, Sypventrolin 1/2 SF band antacid, and apply Quaderiderm on the affected skin. This will cover both allergy and fungal infections. Continue the anti-allergic treatment for three weeks and then stop. Continue Forcan 150 for six weeks. If there is any recurrence, please consult again for advice.

Dementia can indeed have adverse effects on a patient, including reduced cognitive abilities, memory loss, and changes in behavior and mood. However, it is important to note that dementia is not caused by psychological factors alone, and there are multiple potential causes such as age, vascular issues, or neurological problems. It is unlikely that a severe shock such as hearing about a daughter's divorce would directly cause dementia. If you have concerns about a loved one's cognitive health, it is important to consult with a medical professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.",

Today is the 28th day of her cycle, so she may be experiencing uterine cramps, which could be the cause of her abdominal pain - typically intermittent, as you described. These two conditions are not directly related, but continuous sneezing can stimulate the uterus due to increased abdominal pressure during a sneeze. For these reasons, treatment is recommended.\n\nLevocetirizine and selective COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib, can be used to address her symptoms. For severe rhinitis, a beclomethasone nasal spray may also be prescribed. I hope this information helps. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.",

If not, then a nutritious diet is better than any pill. Have lots of green vegetables, apples, and dates.",
    "459": "Thanks for your question. I understand your concern regarding your persistent cough, lightheadedness, and migraines. Coughing can be a symptom of various conditions, such as tuberculosis, upper respiratory infections, lower respiratory tract infections, bronchial asthma, and heart disease.\n\nTo alleviate your symptoms, I recommend consulting a pulmonologist who can prescribe appropriate medications. These may include a proton pump inhibitor like pantoprazole taken once daily before meals, and a bronchodilator syrup containing a combination of an aerosol and guaphenesin to ease coughing due to bronchial constriction.\n\nThe frequent coughing in your case seems to be caused by bronchoconstriction, and the pulmonologist will evaluate the underlying cause by requesting investigations such as a chest X-ray and spirometry. The headaches you are experiencing are likely due to increased intracranial pressure resulting from excessive coughing. As your cough improves, the headaches should decrease as well.\n\nPlease feel free to ask any further questions, and I wish you a speedy recovery and good health.",

    "462": "Hello dear, I would have appreciated knowing when you had your last menstrual period and whether you have missed your period. Missing a period is the first major symptom of pregnancy. Other symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, frequent urination, and breast changes like engorgement and tenderness, dark discoloration of the nipples and areola with an increase in the size of the areola and secretions through the nipples, appear later - maybe about 8-15 days after missing a period. From your history, I could not get the information about whether you are having any of these symptoms. Only a weird feeling in the abdomen cannot be attributed to pregnancy. Nausea and a weird feeling in the abdomen without missing a period could be due to stress or anxiety. Well, if you have missed your period, 8-10 days after that, please do a pregnancy test on your first morning urine; earlier tests may give false negative results. Alternatively, you may get a blood test done which is reliable even a few days before the missed period. If you do not have the facility to undergo either of these tests, you can go for an ultrasound scan about 10-15 days after missing a period which will give you direct visual evidence of your pregnancy status. A clinical examination from an obstetrician about 10 days after missing a period can also give you a clue about your pregnancy status. Somehow, you have to opt for one of the diagnostic measures mentioned above for diagnosing your pregnancy. Of course, if you have not missed your period yet, please wait for your period to arrive. If you get your period, there is no question about pregnancy. I hope this helps you.",

They will be able to perform a thorough evaluation and provide personalized recommendations. In addition, it's important for your husband to also undergo fertility evaluations. Have you had a TORCH test done? This test checks for certain infections that can cause miscarriages. Taking folic acid supplements before and during early pregnancy can also help reduce the risk of miscarriage.

After reviewing your symptoms, the pain you experience when opening your mouth could be due to temporomandibular joint disorder or radiating pain from a tooth infection. I recommend consulting an oral physician for a proper examination. A radiograph of your entire jaw, including OPG and TMJ views, should be taken to determine the cause of the pain. If the pain is originating from a tooth, treatment should be focused on addressing the tooth infection. If the pain is due to TMJ disorder, I suggest taking a proximal tablet twice on the first day, followed by once daily for the next 5 days. Avoid opening your jaw too wide and refrain from eating hard foods for 15 days. I hope this information helps you. Take care.",

Abdominal pain caused by gastroenteritis can disrupt your electrolyte balance and affect your heart function.",
    "478": "Hi, thank you for providing a brief history of your condition. Given that you mentioned direct impact on your knee and soreness in your shin and foot, the first step is to rule out the presence of any old fractures or bony misalignments. This can be done through a CT/MRI/X-ray scan. The type of exercise you perform is also important to consider. Since you had a fall on concrete, the impact could be significant. The impact on landing on muscle will be different from landing on bone, given the hard and soft tissue properties of each. If your X-ray/CT/MRI results are clear, we can proceed to the next step. However, if there are any issues, you must strictly follow orthopedic guidelines. In the meantime, I recommend applying hot water fermentation until you can visit a doctor. Self-medication and self-healing are not advisable, as specialists can provide better assistance. There is no harm in seeking their opinion. I wish you great health with the grace of God.

While they may not be serious, they are cosmetically unappealing. You should consult with a surgeon or vascular surgeon to further investigate and treat the issue. A Doppler dual image study may be recommended to determine the best course of treatment, which may include endogenous laser ablation (EVLT) of the specific incompetent section. Best of luck and early recovery. Feel free to ask any further questions and I will do my best to assist you.",
    "480": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and concern. Given your history of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOC), it's essential to rule out any cardiac causes for your chest discomfort. I recommend getting an ECG and a 2D echo done to ensure that everything is normal. If both tests come back normal, then there's less reason to worry about a cardiac cause.\n\nIn the meantime, gastritis could be causing your symptoms, potentially triggered by the food you ate yesterday. To alleviate your discomfort, consider taking proton pump inhibitors. Additionally, avoid consuming hot and spicy food as it may aggravate your symptoms.\n\nRemember to reduce stress and tension, as they can also impact your physical well-being. Try to stay calm and positive, and you should start feeling better soon. However, prioritize ruling out any cardiac causes by getting the recommended tests done.

I can understand why you and your wife are considering helping them have a second child.\n\nRegarding your wife's tubectomy, it is possible to undergo a reversal procedure called tubal ligation reversal. This surgery involves reopening and reattaching the fallopian tubes, which were previously cut and sealed during the tubectomy. The success rate of the procedure depends on various factors, including the type of tubal ligation performed, the length of the remaining tubal segments, and the patient's age.\n\nThe success rate of pregnancy after tubal ligation reversal is around 50-80%. However, there is also a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy, which is a pregnancy that develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes.\n\nTo proceed with the tubal ligation reversal, your wife would need to undergo a series of tests to assess her fertility and overall health. She may also need to consult with a reproductive endocrinologist or a fertility specialist to discuss her options and the potential risks and benefits of the procedure.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

Your husband needs to receive at least three doses of rabies vaccine on days 0, 3, and 7. Please observe the biting dog for 10 days. If the biting animal shows any symptoms of rabies or dies during this period, your husband needs to receive the remaining two doses of rabies vaccine on days 14 and 28.

    "485": "I reviewed your explanation, and I suggest a strong painkiller since you have already tried other options. However, I recommend combining the painkiller with physical therapy. I understand that daily physical therapy is not affordable for you, so visit an experienced physical therapist and get an exercise program based on the severity of your scoliosis. Follow the same program for 15 days and then visit the physical therapist once every 15 days for a review. Additionally, regularly use a hot pack on your painful area to manage pain with heat, and apply any pain-relieving ointment after using the hot pack for 15 minutes. Keep in mind that scoliosis is a structural problem with the spine that affects the surrounding muscles and nerves. Until you try to correct it, the pain will not go away. In advanced stages, surgical correction is also an option available. You can talk to your orthopedic surgeon or a pain management physician for a detailed opinion on this. I hope this information is helpful to you. Take care.",
    "486": "Hello! Thank you for consulting with a doctor online! Based on your concern, I must inform you that your father's antibody levels are quite high. The limited effectiveness of Myestin is a strong indicator of the potential progression of the disease. This condition can result in respiratory insufficiency, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, I agree with your doctor's suggestion of pursuing a more aggressive treatment plan.\n\nIt's important to weigh the potential side effects of the medications prescribed. An alternative option could be the use of steroids, but they are not recommended for individuals with hypertension, diabetes, gastritis, or ulcers. I'm not aware of any contraindications your father may have for oral steroids.\n\nAdditionally, I would recommend a thoracic CT scan to check for thymic hyperplasia. This elevated antibody level could be related to this disorder, and surgery could be quite beneficial in this case. I hope this information is helpful! Best wishes to you and your father.",
    "487": "Hello! Thank you for reaching out to us. I would like to know on which side your wisdom tooth was extracted, was it on the left or the right? The lump that you are feeling may be due to infection and inflammation of the gingival flap. If the pain is on the same side as where your wisdom tooth was removed, there may be a tooth remnant present. However, if not, then it could be due to peritonitis, which is the inflammation of the gingival flap that covers your erupting tooth. I recommend performing warm saline rinses 3-4 times a day, using an antibacterial mouth rinse twice a day, and visiting your dentist for a thorough clinical check-up and prescription medication. I hope this answers your question and I wish you good health.",
    "490": "Hello, thank you for consulting me. I understand your concerns about rabies. Rabies is a serious disease that requires prompt and adequate treatment to prevent fatalities. As you were bitten by your pet dog, your doctor has recommended a combination of treatments, including TT injection, IDRV injection, and equiralo injection.\n\nThe equiralo injection is a type of immunoglobulin that helps boost your immune system's response to fight the rabies virus. While some people may experience side effects from the injection, it is generally well-tolerated.\n\nYour doctor has also advised you to take the HRIG vaccine, which is a human rabies immunoglobulin that provides immediate protection against the virus. It is important to follow your doctor's recommendations and take the vaccine as prescribed.\n\nRegarding your dog's vaccination status, it is important to keep your pets vaccinated against rabies to prevent them from contracting the disease and transmitting it to humans. However, even vaccinated dogs can carry and transmit the virus, so it is important to seek medical attention if you are bitten by any dog.\n\nIn your case, as the bite was provoked and your dog is vaccinated, the risk of rabies transmission may be lower. However, it is still important to follow your doctor's recommendations and complete the recommended course of treatment to ensure maximum protection against rabies. If you have any further concerns or questions, please consult your doctor.",

The chances are that you may not see it at all. There is no need for concern. I wish you a speedy recovery. God bless and good luck.",
    "492": "Hi, I have gone through your question and understand your concern. A platelet count of 542 is mildly increased and not necessarily a cause for concern. There are many potential causes of reactive thrombocytosis, which is an increase in platelet count. If you do not have any other symptoms, there is no need to worry. Try to relax, as the count may normalize on its own. If you have any further questions or doubts, please feel free to contact me. Wishing you good health.",
    "494": "Hello! As a known asthma patient at just 19 years old, you shouldn't lose hope. There are several measures you can take to manage your asthma and potentially reduce its impact on your life. These include avoiding indoor and outdoor allergens, such as dust, mites, animal allergens, pests, hay, fodder, smoking, fine dusting powder, and sudden changes in temperature. To reduce your exposure to these allergens, you can take the following steps:\n\n* Wash all bed covers in a hot cycle (60 degrees Celsius) every week.\n* Treat carpets with avaricious/tannin acid.\n* Clean upholstered furniture thoroughly or replace it with leather furniture.\n* Keep dust-accumulating objects in a dust cupboard.\n* Hot wash or freeze soft toys.\n* Use a vacuum cleaner regularly.\n* Encase your mattress, pillow, and quilt in impermeable covers.\n* Keep pets out of the living rooms.\n* Install an air conditioner or dehumidifier.\n* Eliminate suitable environments for cockroaches.\n\nIn addition to these measures, I recommend taking montelukast+ albuterol tablets once or twice a day until you experience complete improvement. When you don't have symptoms, you don't need to take the medicine, but when symptoms arise, take the tablet as mentioned. Steam inhalation and hot coffee can also provide relief. I hope these suggestions are helpful for you.",
    "495": "Thank you for your question. It is not uncommon for painful urination to occur following prostate cancer treatment, but it should be thoroughly investigated. Here are some recommended steps: 1. Confirm if there is an infection through a urinalysis. 2. Use CT scan or ultrasound of the pelvis to check for regrowth of prostate cancer. 3. Check PSA levels. 4. Perform a full mammogram to check for bacterial and blood infections. The treatment will depend on the results of these tests. Consulting a urologist and oncologist will be helpful in determining the best course of action.",
    "496": "Hi, Thank you for asking ChatDoctor. After reviewing your query, I suggest ruling out cervical spondylosis as a possibility in your case, as it can cause symptoms such as head heaviness, chest discomfort, and neck pain. A physical examination by an orthopedic specialist and an X-ray of the cervical spine can help confirm this. The typical treatment for this condition includes NSAIDs like diclofenac, muscle relaxants like cyclobenzaprine, and neurotrophic medications. In addition, physiotherapy, neck exercises, and the use of a cervical collar can also be beneficial. Hope this information is helpful to you. Please let me know if you have any further questions.",
    "497": "Hello, and welcome to our chat service. Fungal infections are most common in the genital area, where fungi are normally present but kept in check by helpful organisms. However, when there is an imbalance in the environment, the fungi can multiply and cause an infection. These infections are more common in females due to the short length of the urethra. To treat the infection, I recommend keeping the area clean, using a topical antifungal cream, and taking oral antihistamines. These medications will help to clear up the fungal infection. Thank you for consulting with us.",
    "498": "Hi, thank you for bringing your concern to Chat Doctor. After reviewing your query and considering your health concerns, it appears that your husband may have an infection or old granuloma underneath his belly button, which is causing pain when touched. The appearance of the bump may be concerning, but regular cleaning and oil smearing can help reduce tenderness and soreness in the belly button. Additionally, an antiseptic cream or anti-inflammatory medication may be helpful. To rule out any other potential causes, such as a vitello-intestinal patent duct or racial cyst, an ultrasound or CT scan with contrast study of the belly button may be recommended. I hope this information helps guide your further treatment discussions with your healthcare provider. Please feel free to ask any additional questions, and I wish you both the best of luck and a speedy recovery. Have a good day!",
    "499": "Hello, the treatment of kidney stones depends on various factors such as its composition (whether it is composed of calcium, uric acid, etc.), size of the stone, location, etc. You may need a urine test for stone evaluation. You should consult a doctor. Small stones may pass spontaneously. You may need stone-dissolving medications such as allopurinol (for uric acid stones), diuretics, sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate, phosphorus solutions. Lithotripsy or other procedures may be needed after evaluation. I hope you get well soon. Take care.",
    "500": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. If your stomach ache is caused by gastritis or a peptic ulcer, which are common causes of abdominal pain, you should have experienced some relief with medication and food intake. However, since you have not experienced any relief, I recommend visiting your doctor's office to rule out conditions such as pancreatitis, cholecystitis, etc. A clinical examination and certain blood tests, ultrasound scans may be necessary to reach a diagnosis. I wish you a speedy recovery.",
    "502": "Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I have read your question carefully and would like to explain that your symptoms may be related to a viral infection. A metabolic cause cannot be ruled out. Have you measured your blood pressure in the last few days? I recommend consulting your GP for a thorough physical examination, a resting ECG, and some blood tests: a complete blood count, inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate, fibrinogen), fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, and blood electrolytes. Regarding the neck pain, it could also be caused by a viral infection or sleeping in the wrong position. A cervical spine X-ray may be necessary to rule out a possible cervical disk disorder, which could be causing your neck pain and other symptoms. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, monitoring your blood pressure closely, and getting some rest, avoiding strenuous physical activity. I hope this helps! Best wishes.",
    "503": "Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Chest tightness and difficulty breathing, especially at night, are more suggestive of asthma. Chest X-rays are usually normal in asthma. So it is better to consult a pulmonologist and have a clinical examination of the respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose asthma, but it will also tell you about the severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. She will need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, she will be fine with all these. I hope I have answered your question. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing your daughter good health. Thank you.",
    "504": "Inconsistent compliance with treatment increases the likelihood of non-response. Citalopram worked initially, but later it failed possibly for the same reason, and then you experienced problems with venlafaxine and escitalopram. However, don't lose hope. There are many treatment options available. You have had depression for many years with a poor response to some medications. You need a combined approach to your treatment, including medications, psychotherapy, and lifestyle modifications. Medications such as mirtazapine, milnacipram, sertraline, venlafaxine, etc. can be used along with short-term use of benzodiazepine for anxiety control. Many depression medications cause mild anxiety initially, which subsides on its own over time. Additionally, try relaxation techniques under professional supervision. Regards, Chat Doctor.",
    "506": "Hi, thanks for your question. If the broken tooth is in one piece, it can be saved, but since your tooth is broken into two pieces, it unfortunately cannot be glued back together and the broken piece is not useful. My suggestion is to see a dentist as soon as possible to evaluate the situation and take an x-ray of the tooth. If the nerves are not exposed, a dental filling or crown can be done to replace the broken tooth. If the nerves are exposed, root canal treatment followed by a crown may be necessary. I hope this information helps. Best regards.",

    "508": "Hello! Thank you for reaching out. Your symptoms appear to be related to nightmares and anxiety. It's possible that you may be experiencing a hyper reaction of the autonomic nervous system, which can cause symptoms such as tachycardia, sweating, and body shaking. I recommend that you consult with your general practitioner for a thorough physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x-ray, and some blood tests (thyroid hormone levels, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes, etc.) to rule out any underlying medical conditions. A polysomnography and an ambulatory 24-48 hour ECG monitoring may also be necessary to exclude any sleeping disorders or cardiac arrhythmias. If all the test results come back normal, you may want to consider seeking help from an anxiety specialist who can provide you with anxiolytic medication and behavioral therapy to manage your anxiety. I hope this information is helpful. Best regards.",
    "509": "Hello, Based on your medical history, I do not believe that your symptoms are indicative of sciatica. The pain you are experiencing could be caused by a variety of other factors, such as muscle weakness or changes in the spinal column leading to nerve root entrapment. I recommend that you rest properly in bed and apply hot water fermentation to help release any spasms in the paraspinal muscles that may have occurred as a protective mechanism following the lumbar puncture. We will need to wait and see if there are any changes in your pain and symptoms before we can determine if there is a disc herniation or prolapse. Currently, it appears that you are experiencing muscle spasms in the lumbar region which need to be addressed. Applying ice to the lumbar region may also help to reduce pain. Once the spasms in the paraspinal muscles ease, you should begin to feel better. I hope this answers your question. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to assist you.

It is also advisable to consult an oral surgeon for a clinical examination and radiograph to further investigate the cause of the swelling. Best regards.",

    "512": "Hello! Thank you for reaching out. Based on what you've shared, I recommend taking a pregnancy test since your period is late by 4-5 days. There are kits available that can detect pregnancy as early as the first day of a missed period. If the test is negative, I suggest scheduling a detailed checkup with your gynecologist. Since your husband's report seems to be fine, your doctor may recommend tests to check your hormonal levels and possibly an ultrasound. Continue taking multivitamins as recommended. Regarding your symptoms, they do seem similar to those of morning sickness, but it may be early for those symptoms to show even if you are pregnant. Try not to stress too much as it can negatively impact your chances of conceiving. Good luck!",
    "517": "Hi, thanks for your inquiry to Chat Doctor. Based on the information provided, it seems that your husband is suffering from pneumonitis, which could be caused by an infection or secondary to a lump in the basal segments of the left lung. The syrup prescribed by your doctor will help control the irritation and cough associated with this condition.\n\nTo ensure the right diagnosis, I recommend the following steps: check for causal bacteria, AFB, malignant or benign cells in the sputum; check x-ray lung with PA and oblique views to assess the exact location of the opacity in the left lung; and respond to a course of antibiotics. If there is no history of infectious complaints, I suggest an assessment by fiberoptic bronchoscopy with lavage study for AFB and malignant and benign cells from the suspected lump in the basal bronchial lumen.\n\nGiven the homogenous opacity with no infectious complaints, it is important to consider other possibilities such as adenoma of the bronchus or malignant lesion. These need to be ruled out through further investigation. It could also be due to atelectasis of the lung from blockage of the lower basal bronchial lumen or could be a developing pre-pneumonia consolidation.\n\nFor your husband's age, this is a serious matter that requires further investigation. I recommend consulting with a chest physician or chest surgeon who can assess your husband's case and plan the necessary treatment accordingly. Feel free to ask any further questions or concerns you may have.",

Based on your medical history and the symptoms you have described, there is a possibility that you may be suffering from lung disease, specifically bronchitis. To properly diagnose and treat your condition, I recommend undergoing a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) and a chest X-ray. If the results of these tests are normal, further cardiac evaluation with an ECG and 2D echo may be necessary. It is important to consult with a medical professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

Based on your description, it seems like you are experiencing occasional heart palpitations, which can cause a sensation of fluttering or skipping beats. These symptoms can be benign and often result from stress, fatigue, or other lifestyle factors. To manage your symptoms, I recommend making some lifestyle modifications, such as prioritizing restful sleep, managing stress levels, and maintaining a balanced diet. If your symptoms persist or worsen, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider. They can perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) and run some tests to rule out any underlying causes. I wish you the best of health, and please don't hesitate to contact your doctor for further evaluation and advice.",
    "523": "Thank you for your question on HealthTap. I understand your concern. Elevated blood pressure during exertion is seen in early heart failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), and valvular heart disease. Since you already have hypertension, the likelihood of heart failure and CAD is higher. Therefore, it is better to avoid cardiovascular rehabilitation. First, consult a cardiologist and get an ECG, 2D echo, stress test (treadmill test), and coronary angiography to rule out heart disease. If it is CAD, you may need angioplasty (stenting). You may require diuretics and other cardiac supportive medications. Don't worry, you will be fine with all of these. I hope I have answered your question. I will be happy to help you further.

This condition can be triggered by a variety of factors, including recent infections, insect bites, food, seasonal changes, or other environmental factors. To treat urticaria, I typically recommend taking levocetrizine at night and fexofenadine in the morning for at least one to two weeks. For topical relief, mild to moderate potency steroids may be advised. I hope this information helps, and I recommend discussing my opinion with your doctor for further assessment and treatment.

    "528": "Doctor's response: Hello, thank you for reaching out. I understand your concerns regarding your increased heart rate and difficulty breathing. It's important to note that a normal heart rate ranges between 50-100 beats per minute. When it exceeds 100 beats per minute in a normal sinus rhythm, it is referred to as sinus tachycardia. During tachycardia, you may experience palpitations, a fluttering sensation, anxiety, and difficulties breathing deeply. There are various causes of sinus tachycardia, ranging from emotional stress to consuming caffeine or energy drinks. Your previous breastfeeding history is not related to these symptoms. If I were your treating physician, I would recommend several examinations, such as a cardiac echo, a full blood analysis, thyroid hormone tests, and a holter rhythm monitoring to evaluate your average heart rates and rule out any arrhythmias. After these tests, we can better assess how to proceed and determine if medical treatment is necessary. I hope this information is helpful. Best regards.",
    "529": "The symptoms you are describing are consistent with an allergy. To determine the cause of the allergy, it is recommended that you have tests done by your doctor. They may perform a blood test, urinalysis, and stool examinations to check for allergies. It is possible that the allergy is due to a food item, so it may be helpful to eliminate certain foods from your diet, such as milk and eggs, and see if your symptoms improve. Additionally, avoid using cosmetics, fumes, and perfumes as they may be contributing to your symptoms. Please consult with your doctor for a complete examination and treatment plan.",

    "531": "Hello there! Your Diabetes specialist is correct in advising against the use of Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs in diabetics. Based on your symptoms, it is likely that you are experiencing impingement of one of your spinal nerve roots, commonly known as a slipped disc. This condition is more common in individuals over the age of 50 and can be more challenging to manage in diabetics. I recommend starting with an X-ray of your lumbosacral spine. If the X-ray reveals any issues, you can consult a physiotherapist for appropriate treatment. If the X-ray does not show any problems, an MRI of your spinal cord may be helpful. For pain management, if Tylenol is not effective, you can try Pregabalin 75mg twice a day for the first two weeks, and then once a day at night. It may take up to a week for the medication to start working.",
    "532": "Hi there, it seems like you have a concern about your finger injury. I suggest starting a course of antibiotics such as Sulphamethoxazole and Trimethoprim to prevent infection. You can also take painkillers like Advil, Motrin, or diclofenac to ease the pain.

If the pain is sudden and severe, and there is a change in color in the scrotal area, it is recommended that your son is seen by a doctor immediately. However, if the pain is gradual and accompanied by fever, it is more likely to be an infection. During the examination, the doctor will examine your son's genitals and perform a thorough examination of his abdomen. If there is any suspicion of an underlying issue, your son may be referred for an ultrasound scan.\"",

Therefore, we need to rule out arrhythmia first. So, get an ECG, 2D echo, and Holter monitoring (24-hour continuous monitoring of ECG) done. If all of them are normal, then there is no need to worry about arrhythmia. Sometimes, muscular twitching can also cause fluttering sensations. Calcium deficiency is a common cause of this. So, get your calcium levels checked and if there is a deficiency, you may need supplements. Stress and anxiety are another cause of fluttering.

If not, you can also consider taking medications such as camphene to aid in follicle growth and track your follicle growth through repeated ultrasounds. When your follicle size reaches over 17-18mm, you can take an injection to rupture the follicle. Have sexual intercourse every 2-3 days after your period stops.

    "554": "Hello, the sores you are describing seem to be ruptured vesicular lesions, most commonly associated with a viral herpes infection. These types of ulcers are common on the lips and corners of the mouth and are often accompanied by fever prior to the eruption of vesicles. If your fever persists, you can manage it with paracetamol tablets. Your dietary intake of vitamins and minerals may also be reduced due to difficulty swallowing, so you can use an anesthetic gel or mouthwash to relieve pain during swallowing. It is recommended to have a diet rich in fruits and green leafy vegetables, or to take nutritional supplements. Use antiseptic mouthwashes after meals and avoid spicy food altogether. In healthy individuals, these lesions usually resolve within 7 days with proper diet. If they persist longer than that, consult an oral medicine specialist who may prescribe antiviral creams or tablets as needed. To confirm the diagnosis, they may take a biopsy for pathological examination. Other rare causes of such sores include autoimmune disorders such as Memphis and lichen planus, which can be diagnosed through a biopsy or immunofluorescence test.",

While it's possible that you may have pulled a stitch or muscle, as mentioned by the on-call doctor, there could be other causes for your pain. If you are in the early post-operative period, an infection could be causing the throbbing pain. Another possibility is damage to small nerve twigs that lie in the incision line.

Lymph nodes are normally present in the body and can enlarge in two conditions: 1) if there is an infection in the vicinity of the lymph node, and 2) in lymphoma, which is cancer of the lymph node. The most common cause is infection in their vicinity. Since your superficial lymph nodes are enlarged, most probably you have an infection somewhere in your sinuses, throat, or even ear. The best way to relieve your tension is to have a FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) of the enlarged lymph nodes to determine the cause of their enlargement. I hope this answers your question.",
    "560": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Hormone therapies for prostate cancer can cause some side effects because they reduce the levels of male hormones in the body. Some of the problems your husband is experiencing can be attributed to the hormonal therapy. It is very common to feel tired and experience body aches due to these treatments. Another common side effect is osteoporosis (thinning of the bones), which can cause leg pain. However, the fever may not be related to his disease or treatment; it could be due to a urinary infection. I recommend consulting your general practitioner regarding this issue. Regards.",
    "561": "Hello, thank you for consulting ChatDoctor. Based on your description of your mother's symptoms and medical history, I suggest that you consult a dentist for treatment of her tooth infection, as medication alone can only provide temporary relief.

Additionally, advise her to do warm saline gargles two to three times a day. I hope this helps and wish your mother good health.",
    "566": "Hello, thank you for consulting Chat Doctor. I have reviewed your history and would like to make the following suggestions for you: 1. As your asthma is currently not well controlled, I suggest using an albuterol inhaler for asthma symptoms/wheezing/breathing difficulties for 5-7 days, depending on your response. 2. If you have associated nasal symptoms such as nasal congestion, sneezing, nasal discharge, etc., I would also recommend adding montelukast and levocetirizine to your treatment. 3. If there is no improvement despite using the albuterol inhaler, your doctor may prescribe a short course of corticosteroids. 4. In order to provide more specific advice on improving your asthma, I would need more details about your health, such as your age, weight, frequency of asthma symptoms, any nasal symptoms, any digestive symptoms, any allergies, any skin allergies, previous medications used, etc. These details will help me to better understand your condition and make more specific recommendations. 5. For patients with frequent asthma attacks, I usually prescribe regular medications and inhalers such as montelukast, inhaled corticosteroids, etc. 6. I would also recommend spirometry, which measures your lung capacity, as well as allergy testing for common airborne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, pollen, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help you to identify substances you may be allergic to. 7. In addition, regular physical exercise, including breathing exercises, and a nutritious diet rich in vitamins and minerals will help you in the long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity, respectively. Please ensure you are drinking an adequate amount of fluids to maintain hydration. 8. Please avoid exposure to dust, smoke, and air pollution as much as possible. I hope the above suggestions will be helpful to you. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask Chat Doctor. Wishing you the best of health in the future. Thank you and regards.",
    "567": "Hi, I understand that you are going through a difficult time. Based on the information you have provided, it is possible that your mother is experiencing heart failure. However, further investigations are necessary to confirm the cause of the fluid buildup and to determine the best course of treatment. It would be helpful to know if there is a known cause for your mother's heart failure, such as a previous heart attack, and if there are any associated conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems. Additionally, any symptoms such as coughing, swelling, or fever could provide further clues.\n\nTo properly investigate and manage your mother's condition, the following tests may be recommended: blood tests to assess various body functions, urine examination to check for infections, ECG and 2D Echo of the heart to evaluate heart function, ultrasound of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and a CT scan of the chest.\n\nDepending on the results of these investigations, treatment options may include antibiotics and diuretics.

Usually, bleeding in postmenopausal women should be screened for malignancy (cancer). Early diagnosis leads to a better prognosis. It is recommended that you consult a gynecologist and undergo D&C (dilation and curettage). A histopathological report will provide information about your endometrial status.

There are many reasons for high ALP (alkaline phosphatase) levels in the blood, including liver disease, bone disease, or intestinal causes. It's good to hear that your husband is undergoing an abdominal ultrasound test on February 24th, 2011.\n\nIn terms of his specific situation with a fatty liver and high cholesterol levels (HDL-38, LDL-139, and triglycerides-242), these could be contributing factors to the increase in ALP.

    "577": "Hi, thank you for providing a brief history of yourself. Based on your history, I recommend undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine as it is essential to assess the status of the soft tissue. I strongly advise against continuing with massage as it can weaken the muscles, especially when combined with strengthening exercises. Instead, it is crucial to have an MRI first and then, based on the results, a combination of medication and physical therapy can be tailored to your specific needs. The physical therapist you choose should be knowledgeable about the differences between patients and their symptoms and create a specialized plan for you. A conventional approach to therapy may not be as effective. In my clinical practice, I have seen cases with a 100% recovery rate, but this was only possible after understanding the MRI results and prescribing appropriate medication. My goal is to design a personalized physical therapy plan that will lead to a full recovery. Remember, slow and steady wins the race - this is our clinic principle. I look forward to seeing you soon, with a pain-free life. Best regards, Dr. Jay.",
    "578": "Hello, Acne is a common skin condition that occurs in areas with rich sebum, such as the face, upper back, and upper chest. Acne can manifest in different forms, such as comedones, papules, pustules (pus-filled), and cystic nodular. The pustular and cystic nodular types are known to leave scars. Hormonal changes, puberty, excessive use of cosmetics, and stress can cause or aggravate acne. Here are a few things you should follow: 1) Avoid rubbing your face too hard when washing and wiping, instead pat dry. 2) Avoid make-up, and if you need to use it, opt for water-based products. 3) Avoid picking or breaking the acne as it increases the spread. Keep your nails short to avoid accidental pricking. 4) Use a face wash instead of soap as it prevents dryness. Consider consulting a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment as acne can lead to scarring. They may prescribe topical or oral medications to help control and prevent future breakouts.",

    "587": "Hello, Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor. Forum. Since you mentioned the presence of blood in the urine and you had a CT scan without dye, the main question is whether the report is normal without dye. It depends on the nature of the disease in the kidney, for example, if a tumor is present in the kidney, it is very difficult to visualize without dye (contrast media). In this case, the only option available is to get an MRI of the urinary tract system. However, in my experience, urine may contain blood for many reasons. But in your case, as serum creatinine levels are normal, GFR is also normal, so there is no need to worry. If blood reappears in the urine, consult a nephrologist for his opinion. Good luck.",
    "589": "Hello, thank you for trusting Chat Doctor. I would prefer a more concise and detailed history note from you. However, I would also like to know the bilirubin levels, as well as any associated symptoms such as itching, decreased appetite, or vomiting along with increased levels of bilirubin. Jaundice is a symptom of the rise of yellowish pigments (bilirubin in your body) which are normally converted by the liver into soluble forms and excreted into the gut to be excreted out of the body in the stools. The first incidence of its rise, which you experienced in your neonatal life and resolved itself, is a type called physiological jaundice and is not considered a disease, so there is no need to worry about that. But the second incidence in your adolescence may be due to acute hepatitis, which in most cases is viral. However, its recurrence is a greater concern as it requires a detailed evaluation to rule out any other cause of chronic liver disease. Although such higher levels of ALT are usually present in Hepatitis A or E, which resolves itself in approximately 1-2 weeks. Your GGT levels indicate around 5 times the normal levels of your age group, which suggests intrahepatic homeostasis or inflammatory hepatitis, again favoring an acute inflammatory cause that is most likely viral and is a water-borne disease with self-remission. If these levels were as high as 10-30 times, we would have suspected any obstruction of bilirubin outflow (aka biliary tract diseases), which are unlikely in your case. Additionally, there are some diseases that interfere with the conversion of insoluble bilirubin into soluble ones or with excretion inside liver cells due to enzyme deficiencies. When present or detected in adolescence or later, it is mostly Gilbert's disease, which only requires monitoring along with symptomatic care and no long-term treatment. If I were your physician, I would order viral sexologies for hepatitis, along with an ultrasound for liver size and structure as well as outflow tracts from the liver and their patency, and albumin-globulin ratios. I would also be interested in knowing the synthetic functions of your liver by monitoring INR to see if there is any need for vitamin K supplementation. The ideal treatment is rest, fluids, and a healthy diet. Also, if you are experiencing symptoms of itching, decreased appetite, severe vomiting, or dark-colored stools, please seek immediate medical attention.",
    "591": "The pain you are experiencing is likely due to the passage of the kidney stone and not the medications themselves. Kidney stone pain, also known as renal colic, is often described as being more severe than the pain of childbirth. The medications you are taking, Arthrotec for pain and Tamsulosin to aid in the stone's passage, should help increase the chances of spontaneous passage, which is around 70-80% for a 5mm stone. However, the waiting time for spontaneous passage can be up to 2 weeks. The pain in your lower abdomen indicates that the stone is moving down towards your bladder. If the medications are not providing sufficient pain relief or if the pain is severe, you may require emergency endoscopic removal of the stone.

    "597": "Dear Overthinks,\n\nThank you for writing to me. I understand your concerns regarding your mother's health. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) can be a challenging condition to manage, and I have seen many patients with this diagnosis.\n\nWhile it is difficult to treat CKD solely with medications, they can help maintain a constant level of serum creatinine. However, this is not the case for all patients. A kidney transplant is the ultimate treatment for CKD, but if that is not possible, dialysis may be necessary.\n\nRegarding your question about when to start dialysis, this decision is made by your nephrologist based on your mother's clinical situation and not solely on her creatinine level. Dialysis is typically recommended when there is metabolic acidosis, edema that is not responding to medication, or an increase in creatinine that is not controlled by medication.\n\nI suggest that your mother avoids eating fruits as they may contain high levels of potassium which can be harmful for patients with CKD. Additionally, please speak with your nephrologist as they can provide further guidance and answer any additional questions you may have.\n\nI hope I have addressed some of your concerns.

    "599": "Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. There are two possibilities when it comes to breast issues: fibroadenomas, which cause pain and diffuse modularity without a well-formed swelling in the breast, and fibroadenoma, which presents as a well-formed, freely movable swelling in the breast that is not painful. For fibroadenomas, primrose and Evian can be useful treatments. However, for well-formed fibroadenomas, surgical removal is the recommended treatment, and medication alone is unlikely to reduce the swelling. At the age of 26, the likelihood of having cancer is very low unless there is a strong family history of breast cancer among blood-related females. If you have any doubts, you can consider getting a FNAC test, which involves needle aspiration of the swelling to determine if it is cancerous or not. I hope this information is helpful to you.

    "615": "Thank you for your question on HealthTap. I can understand your concern. Barbecue causes a lot of smoke exposure, and inhaling smoke can cause irritation and inflammation of the airways, which is known as bronchitis. It is not seen in all individuals, but some exposed people can develop it, and bronchitis can cause similar shortness of breath. So, in my opinion, you most likely have bronchitis. Therefore, it is better to consult a pulmonologist and get the following done: 1. Clinical examination of the respiratory system, 2. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). The PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you the severity of the disease, and treatment is based on severity. You will most likely improve with inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Don't worry, you will be alright. I hope I have answered your question.

If both of these tests are normal, then there is no need to worry about cardiac causes. Muscular spasm is likely in your case. To alleviate the spasm, avoid heavy weight lifting and strenuous exercise. Also, avoid sleeping in bad postures. Refrain from movements that cause pain. Take muscle relaxant tablets and apply warm water pads on the affected areas. Gentle massage over the involved region can also be helpful. Don't worry, you will be alright.

The PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about the severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will need an inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

There are many reasons for neck gland enlargement, which can vary depending on your location, ethnicity, and dietary habits. In order to make a diagnosis, it is important to have a detailed description of the lump, including its exact location, shape, whether it is painful or not, movable or fixed, and whether there is ulceration or inflammation present on the underlying skin. Additionally, it is important to look for any constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue, etc. Please provide me with more information about your past medical history, surgical history, and any medications you are currently taking. Thank you and I wish you the best of luck.",
    "626": "Hello, thank you for providing a brief history of your condition. I recommend a thorough neuromuscular assessment. As you mentioned, you have a past history of seizures and you recently had an accident, but I don't believe the two are connected. Your current issue of knee pain is due to the accident. If the insurance company is causing problems, obtain a note from a neurologist stating that the knee injury is not related to the seizure episodes, and also get a note from an orthopedic doctor. This way, you are legally allowed to proceed with the claim and the insurance company should not have any issues. Best regards, Jay (Chat Doctor).",
    "627": "The spine is the bone in the midline of the back, composed of multiple pieces stacked on top of each other. In between these pieces, there are discs. If a disc becomes weak, the bone may slip, potentially pressing on the spinal cord or nerves that exit between the spinal pieces. This pressure can cause nerve weakness or even paralysis. It is important for your friend to see a nerve specialist to prevent or treat these issues. I wish them good luck.",

As she has tolerated Novaclox well in the past, it may be possible to switch to that medication. However, I recommend consulting with her doctor first before making any changes to her prescription. It's important to ensure that the medication she is taking is appropriate for her specific condition and that any potential side effects are managed properly.",
    "631": "Hi, There are different types of fast heart rates. The first one is when a patient's normal rhythm increases. In this case, there is no need for any surgery, and it is treated with medications. The second most frequent cause of fast heart rate is atrial fibrillation. In this case, if the rhythm is not restored, we try to do it with medications or electrical cardioversion. If there are multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation, the patient may be advised to have an invasive correction, which is a mini-operation. However, there are also patients who remain with atrial fibrillation, and their heart rate is regulated with medications. There are other fast heart rhythms such as atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia. In every case, the treatment can be either with medications or a mini-operation, depending on the patient's parameters. But if your father doesn't want to undergo surgery, it is his right and choice, and he can be managed with medications. I hope this was helpful. Wishing you good health. In case of further questions, don't hesitate to ask. Regards.",
    "632": "Hello, dear. To be honest, episodic rolling back of the tongue with numbness in the legs does not fit with any specific organic disease in the body. While some patients with dystonia may experience episodic rolling back of the tongue, simultaneous numbness in the legs is not typically associated with it.

However, if you are anemic, it can be started even before conception. Please consult your gynecologist to learn about your ovulation cycle. Having sexual intercourse on the days of ovulation greatly increases the chances of conception. Ensure that your routine blood tests and your husband's reports are normal. Best of luck.",
    "636": "Dear patient, Your past history of surgery on your ankle with an implant in place and the current pain you are experiencing may be due to a recent infection or screw breakage. Since there is also swelling, an infection is more likely. I would recommend getting an X-ray of your involved ankle in anteroposterior and lateral views to confirm the diagnosis. Visit a radiology center near you to get this done. If the X-ray shows signs of osteomyelitis, you should consult an expert orthopedic surgeon near you for further examination. A complete blood count also needs to be done, and if there is an increased total leukocyte count, it will also support the presence of an infection. Best of luck.",

However, they are essential for the health of pregnant women. Generally, these food supplements are considered beneficial for health, but in some cases, they may have side effects, depending on the patient's immune system and allergic history.

    "639": "Hi, As you have not received any injections in the past five months, it is unlikely that your current symptoms or the negative pregnancy test are due to the previous demo shots. Natural ovulation is likely to have occurred, so you should get a serum beta-hCG test to confirm or rule out pregnancy as this test is very sensitive and specific. You should also get a transvaginal ultrasound to further evaluate your condition. I hope this information is helpful to you. Wishing you good health.",

As you took the i-pill after 36 hours, it will be 80-85% effective in preventing pregnancy. So there is a 0-20% chance of pregnancy. However, the i-pill can cause a delay in your period by 8-10 days. If your period is delayed by more than 2 weeks, then please take a urine pregnancy test or a blood test to rule out pregnancy. If you are pregnant, you can still terminate an intrauterine pregnancy with an abortion pill under the supervision of a gynecologist.

The only treatment options are chemotherapy and radiotherapy, both of which have side effects and can lead to low platelet and low white blood cell counts due to the destruction of blood cells. Platelet and hemoglobin levels can be maintained through blood transfusions, and granulocyte-stimulating factors can be useful to increase total counts.

In your case, it is possible that the increased SGPT is related to pravastatin, so it is appropriate for you to temporarily stop using it. You may need to adjust the dosage of statins. You may also need further tests such as a routine blood test, random blood sugar test, lipid profile test, and an ultrasound of the abdomen.

If her fever is over 100F, you can give her paracetamol in a dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6 hours.

Over time, even if you are under a specific form of therapy, one treatment method may not be enough to completely clear up your acne. This is based on various internal hormonal stimuli that can change over time.\n\nIn the meantime, continue with your current medication, but avoid using heavy or thick creams. Use only gel-based moisturizers and sunscreen for regular use. You can also use a cleanser containing salicylic acid or glycolic acid on a regular basis.\n\nConsider taking salicylic acid peels from a qualified dermatologist to achieve better control of your acne. These are safe and latest methods that can help you achieve better control without the side effects of long-term antibiotic therapies.\n\nHowever, do not change your dosage without following up with your doctor. Also, use the creams initially on alternate days, and as your skin tolerates it, you can make it daily use.\n\nAcne is a recurrent condition, so it is essential to maintain control by doing frequent follow-ups with your doctor and changing medications as and when required.

It often occurs when the baby sucks on the breast too fast and swallows air. Unless the air is released through burping or flatulence, the discomfort will persist. To prevent this, check if the baby is sucking too fast and swallowing air. Usually, I do not recommend any medications for this as they only provide temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress are: 1) Do not lay the baby down after feeding until they have burped out the swallowed air, and 2) if the baby is still crying, place them on their stomach and gently pat their back to help them pass gas and relieve the discomfort.

    "683": "Hi, thanks for your question. As is often believed, darker lips do not indicate smoking or alcohol consumption! Many people have genetic predisposition, although their parents may or may not have it. A common cause of non-genetic lip darkening is the use of lipsticks/colored balms/glosses, as these tend to darken the lips over time. So try not to use it too often. If you have to use it, make sure it's allegedly free and replace it every 2 months. I would advise you to start using medicated lip balms with SPF and reapply them several times a day to help reduce further darkening. You can also use a cream containing comic acid twice a day to lighten the color of your lips. You can also opt for mild chemical peels once every 15-30 days for better exfoliation and faster lightening. Take care!",

As you are overweight, there may be a spine disc problem, so an X-ray of the spine to see the condition of the spine may be needed. An MRI may also provide valuable information. Please continue to take medication for your thyroid and triglycerides. Take care and good luck.",
    "703": "Hi, I have gone through your question and I can understand your concern. It is possible that you may have a benign breast lesion, such as a cyst, fibroadenoma, or some other type of cancer. I recommend that you go for a mammogram and biopsy of the lump to get an exact diagnosis. Once you have the diagnosis, you can then take the appropriate treatment. I hope I have answered your question, but if you have any doubts, please feel free to ask. Thanks for using Chat Doctor and I wish you the best of health.",
    "706": "Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. From what you've described, it sounds like your son may be experiencing recurring viral infections, which can cause fever and vomiting. It's not uncommon for children to experience fever for several days without any other symptoms. The key thing to look out for is how your son is behaving between fever episodes on the same day. If he's active and playing when he's not feeling hot, it's likely that he has a viral illness and doesn't need antibiotics. Viral fevers can last for 4-7 days, so try not to worry too much about the duration if your son is otherwise active and seemingly well. Keep an eye on his symptoms and consult with a doctor if you have any concerns. Regards -",
    "707": "Hello, I understand your concerns about colon cancer. However, based on your symptoms and test results, it is unlikely that you have colon cancer. Bloody mucus in stool can be a symptom of many conditions, including gastritis, ulcerative colitis, and IBS, among others. Your doctor has already prescribed medication for your stomach ulcer, which should help improve your symptoms. Additionally, your mental health can also affect your physical health, so it's important to continue taking care of your mental well-being. I would recommend following up with your doctor if your symptoms persist or worsen, but trying not to worry excessively as it can negatively impact your health. Colonoscopies are generally recommended starting at age 50, or earlier if there is a family history of colon cancer or other risk factors. However, your doctor can advise you on whether a colonoscopy is necessary based on your individual situation.",
    "708": "Hi,\n\nThank you for reaching out. It appears that your cancer is currently under control, which is positive news. However, close monitoring of your COPD will be necessary.\n\nGiven that your PET scan shows no evidence of cancer and you have undergone brain radiation treatment, the likelihood of cancer recurrence seems low. Still, it's essential to remain vigilant and promptly address any health concerns that may arise.\n\nPlease ensure you maintain regular follow-ups with your oncologist. In terms of your COPD, it's a condition characterized by persistent obstruction in the smaller airways, leading to restricted airflow. Spirometry and lung function tests are crucial to assess your lung capacity. With appropriate medications and oxygen support, it's possible to maintain relatively normal lung function.\n\nThe survival rate for COPD depends on the severity of the condition. Generally, the prognosis for COPD is more favorable than for cancer. To manage your symptoms effectively, consider having small, frequent meals and engaging in breathing rehabilitation techniques to enhance your breathing capacity.\n\nTry not to worry unduly, and please stay in close contact with your healthcare providers.",

Based on your description, it is likely that you are experiencing arthritis in your knee, which is commonly caused by age-related degeneration of bones. This condition is often bilateral, but in your case, it appears that the left knee joint space reduction and degeneration is severe.\n\nIn addition to the knee issue, you are also complaining of pain throughout the lower limb, which could be caused by degenerative changes in the spine.\n\nThe treatment for your condition can include both medical and surgical options. Medical management typically includes painkillers, glucosamine (to improve cartilage growth), and calcium supplementation. However, since you are experiencing pain throughout your lower limb, it is important that you consult an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nPlease make an appointment to see an orthopedic specialist as soon as possible to discuss your options and develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs.",

An initial X-ray of the ankle joint is necessary to rule out any bony injuries. If the X-ray does not show any fractures, then an MRI scan is needed to determine the condition of the ligaments around the ankle joint. I recommend that you consult an orthopedic surgeon for a thorough evaluation and further management.

Omeprazole is an antacid and is only effective in gastritis-related chest pain, which is not on both sides of the chest. Therefore, I recommend stopping the use of Omeprazole. Apply a warm compress to the affected areas of the chest. Take painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication. Avoid movements that cause pain, heavy lifting, and strenuous exercise. Wear a chest belt. With these measures, you should see improvement within 5-7 days. I hope this answers your question. If you have any further concerns, please feel free to ask. Wishing you good health. Thank you.",
    "712": "Good day, the severity of horseshoe kidneys may affect your son's boxing career due to the abnormal location of the kidneys. The usual location of the kidneys for patients with horseshoe kidneys is in the anterior abdomen or behind the stomach. On the other hand, the normal location of the kidneys is at the flank area, protected by the ribs and a significant amount of fat to cushion the kidneys. Therefore, the abnormal location of your son's kidneys may limit his involvement in professional or even amateur boxing, as it would increase the risk of injury to his kidneys. Surgery can be performed to place both kidneys in their normal anatomic location, although this is a major operation with considerable risks. I hope I have answered your question, and I wish you the best.",
    "713": "Hello, I am happy to help you with your question today. You can switch from the contraceptive patch to a birth control pill without waiting for your menstrual cycle to start. Simply remove the patch on the scheduled day and start taking the new pills the next day. Cigarette will be effective immediately as a contraceptive, so you do not need to use any backup methods. However, please note that Cigarette is a progesterone-only pill, which means it may not provide regular menstrual cycles and is less effective than combination birth control pills or the patch. The patch is over 99% effective, while Cigarette is only about 92% effective unless you are breastfeeding. Therefore, while switching birth control methods should not cause any complications, you should be aware that Cigarette may be less effective than the patch you were previously using. I hope this information was helpful and adequately answered your question. Best wishes.",
    "714": "Hello dear, The most common cause of persistent headache with a feeling of heaviness while you are awake is Tension Type Headache (TTH), which is a stress-associated headache. However, in clinical practice, migraine is often confused with TTH, and sometimes both may overlap. Migraine is typically an episodic, hemicranial, pulsatile headache that is precipitated by triggering factors such as cheese, coffee, smoking, bright light, loud sound, stress, lack of sleep. Migraine can be associated with nausea, photophobia (increased headache with bright light), phonophobia (increased headache with talking or sound), or visual abnormalities (such as seeing zigzag or flashing lights, half words or alphabets). You may have TTH or migraine, possibly in that order. Burbs are not related to this condition. TTH can be effectively managed with lifestyle modifications and over-the-counter pain medications, while migraine may require prescription medications. It is recommended that you visit a neurologist for proper evaluation and management of your symptoms.",

This condition is characterized by mild, scaly patches with hypopigmentation and little to no itching. It is a harmless and self-curable condition. Additionally, it may be caused by various factors such as worms, infections in the body, malnutrition, sun exposure, and soap. To treat this condition, I recommend applying a mild potent steroid cream or tacrolimus 0.03 percent. Taking vitamins and anti-worm tablets may also be beneficial. However, it is still advisable to consult with an expert for further assistance. OK.",

Based on your description, it sounds like you are experiencing nerve-related symptoms such as electric shock sensations and numbness in your hands, as well as hardening and soreness in your tendons. There could be a variety of potential causes for these symptoms, including nerve compression, diabetes, or other conditions. I recommend that you consult with a neurologist for a proper evaluation. They may order tests such as nerve conduction studies or electromyography to assess for nerve damage. Depending on the findings, treatment options could include nerve supplements or surgery to release compressed nerves. Additionally, given your history of diabetes, it may be helpful to see an endocrinologist as well. I hope this information helps, and I wish you the best on your journey to recovery.",

A clinical examination of your shoulder and an MRI may be necessary to rule out any associated pathologies. 3. Yes, I recommend that you undergo physiotherapy along with mild exercises to manage your condition. 4. As for urine therapy, I do not recommend it. Urine is not sterile and contains chemicals that are meant to be discarded by the body. There is a risk of infection, especially in individuals with diabetes. It is important to keep your blood sugar levels within the normal range. Additionally, regular exercise, weight reduction, and eating multiple small meals can be helpful in managing your diabetes.

To help manage his condition, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Antireflux therapy: Your son should be prescribed proton pump inhibitors and antiemetics to help alleviate his symptoms.\n2. Propped-up position: When lying down, make sure your son is in a propped-up position, using a care seat or similar support. Avoid letting him sleep completely flat on his back.\n3. Modify feeding habits: Reduce the amount of food your son eats at each meal and avoid giving him heavy or large meals. Instead, offer small, frequent feedings throughout the day.\n4.

    "732": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. You shouldn't be overly concerned, but further testing is necessary. Ca 125 is used for the detection and monitoring of ovarian and some other cancers, but it can also be found in many benign disorders such as endometriosis, ovarian cysts, pancreatitis, or ovarian infection and inflammation. Ovarian cancers are rare, but they can occur in your age group, unfortunately. You should have an ultrasound or CT scan to rule out anything serious. Most likely, this is either an ovarian cyst or a menstrual or hormonal disorder, which is easily treatable. I wish you good health.",
    "733": "Hello Amid. Thank you for your inquiry. Did you have an attack of cholecystitis? The most common cause of such an attack is the presence of a gallstone, and it usually does not cause jaundice unless you have cholangitis or, as you rightly said, the stone goes into the common bile duct. Therefore, I suggest you undergo an upper abdomen ultrasound to determine the exact cause. If the jaundice is due to hepatitis, it will return to normal in a few days. Properly evaluate your jaundice. Go for liver function tests. Take care.",

From what you've described, it appears that you have been managing Hepatitis B since January 2006 and have been taking Lamivir & Adesera. Your viral load (DNA) has been below baseline for the past two years, but your recent routine checkup shows a spike in viral load (DNA), SGPT (450), and SGOT (236).\n\nElevated SGPT and SGOT levels are indicators of liver injury or inflammation. In your case, given your history with Hepatitis B, this could be related to a reactivation of the virus or it could be due to other factors such as alcohol consumption, certain medications, or other liver diseases.\n\nIt is essential to consult a gastroenterologist or a liver specialist as soon as possible. They may recommend a combination of diagnostic tests such as liver function tests, an ultrasound, a FibroScan, or even a liver biopsy to get a clear understanding of the extent of liver damage.\n\nTreatment options will largely depend on the underlying cause. If the elevation is due to viral reactivation, changes in antiviral therapy may be necessary. If it's due to other factors, lifestyle modifications or other interventions may be recommended.\n\nIn the meantime, it's crucial to avoid alcohol, maintain a balanced diet, and minimize stress on the liver. Remember, this is general advice and consulting a specialist is paramount for personalized and accurate treatment.",

Based on the information you provided, I would like to offer the following advice:\n\n1. It's normal for kids to be active and playful, even if they're not eating well. However, it's important to monitor their development closely and ensure they are growing and developing properly.\n2. As children grow, their interest in food often decreases, while their interest in play activities increases. It's common for them to eat smaller quantities of food and prefer to run and play. As a parent, it's important to be patient and offer them small, frequent meals throughout the day.\n3. Instead of focusing on the quantity of food your daughter eats, try to concentrate on the number of times you feed her. Also, make sure the food you give her is calorie-dense by adding a good amount of ghee to it. This will help her gain weight and improve her overall health.\n4. I do not recommend using appetite stimulants on a long-term basis as they may have negative side effects.\n\nIn addition to the above advice, I suggest you consult a pediatrician in your area for a thorough evaluation of your daughter's health. The pediatrician can assess her weight, height, and overall development and offer further guidance on improving her appetite and weight.\n\nI hope this information helps you.

Treatment would involve surgical removal and a biopsy to rule out cancer, as you have a fear of death due to your mother's history of oral cancer. I hope this answers your question. Welcome to ask any further questions on this or any other topic. Have a good day!",
    "777": "Thank you for your query. I can imagine the miserable situation you are in, but don't worry. Based on the information you have provided, I recommend getting blood and urine culture tests to determine bacterial sensitivity. An ultrasound of the abdomen may also be useful. Please consult with your doctor to choose the appropriate antibiotic treatment based on the culture reports for 7 days, either intravenously or orally, depending on your facility. For treating sores, please take antacids and B complex tablets. The decreased immune system can be improved with appropriate antibiotics, antipyretics, and B complex supplements, which will help alleviate your symptoms. Don't worry, the situation will improve.",
    "778": "You should consider revising your diagnosis. Typically, psoriasis does not cause itching. However, koebnerization (the appearance of lesions at the site of trauma) can be distressing in psoriasis. The pimple-like lesions you described may be due to a mutated form of psoriasis that appears after an infection elsewhere. Psoriasis treatment often involves the use of steroids, which should be tapered carefully whether applied topically or taken orally to avoid rebound phenomena. For itching, you can take an anti-itch tablet.",
    "779": "Hello, the persistent UTI may be due to resistance to ciprofloxacin. Although it is a good choice empirically, nowadays many germs have developed resistance against it. Your husband may need antibiotics based on the culture and sensitivity report of his urine. I also suggest routine investigations such as a routine urine test, random blood sugar test, and renal function test. He should consult a doctor who may also prescribe alkalizing syrups. With proper antibiotics, your husband will be fine. Wishing him a speedy recovery. Take care.",

However, I understand that you are concerned about a family history of cancer and want to ensure that you are not at risk.\n\nTo address your concerns, I recommend that you undergo a testis ultrasound scan to investigate the cause of your dull pain and any swelling in your left testicle. This scan will provide a detailed view of your testicles and any surrounding structures, which will help us determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, please wear loose inner clothes to avoid any further discomfort.

I understand your concern about your 75-year-old father who is experiencing swallowing difficulty after taking two courses of antibiotics for a cough. It is important to rule out any obstructive lesions in the esophagus, so I recommend consulting a gastroenterologist and getting an upper GI copy done. If the results are normal, then a chest x-ray and Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) should be done to check for lung infection or bronchitis, both of which can cause chronic cough. Please consult a doctor to discuss these options. I hope this information helps, and I wish your father a speedy recovery.",
    "784": "Hello, thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Your uric acid levels are slightly higher, and the renal stone may be due to high uric acid levels.

Please let me know if you have any further concerns.",
    "786": "Hello, thank you for consulting with me. I'm sorry to hear about your loss. I understand your desire to explore all options, but unfortunately, it is not possible to extract viable sperm 5 days after death, even if the body is kept cool in the mortuary. The standard window for sperm extraction is 36 to 72 hours after death, and beyond that, the cells, including the sperm, begin to die. I know this may be difficult to accept, but I want to be honest with you. I suggest that you consider other options, such as using frozen sperm or exploring adoption or surrogacy. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to support you during this difficult time. Take care.",
    "788": "Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Based on your history and description, it is more likely related to bronchitis and allergies rather than a heart-related issue. Uncontrolled bronchitis and allergies can cause worsening inflammation in the lungs, which can lead to a burning sensation. Therefore, it is better to consult a pulmonologist and undergo a clinical examination of the respiratory system and a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT). The PFT will provide information on the severity of the inflammation. Treatment is typically advised based on the PFT results, with inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) being the preferred treatment options. So, please consult a pulmonologist to discuss all of these options. I hope this answers your question. If you have any further concerns, please feel free to ask. Wishing you good health.

Assuming that he had osteoarthritis, these could be the causes of his calf pain. \n\n1. The most common cause in osteoarthritis patients is varus deformity, where the legs start bending inwards. If this was the reason for his pain, he may experience relief now that he has undergone replacement surgery, which also corrects the deformity.\n\n2. Calcium and vitamin deficiencies can also cause calf pain, so he should start taking supplements.\n\n3. An imbalance of sodium and potassium levels can contribute to calf muscle pain, so he may need to take oral medication to address this issue.\n\n4. Wearing improperly designed footwear can also cause calf muscle pain.\n\n5. Chronic venous malformations in the calf muscles, such as varicose veins or venous incompetence, can be a cause of pain.

You should get a physical examination to check for the presence of a varicocele, as 50% of infertile men have this condition and it can often be easily corrected with surgery. Wearing loose underwear can also help to improve your sperm parameters. Additionally, you should have at least two sperm analyses done one month apart to accurately determine if there is an abnormality and to ensure that you are in good health (no cough, no flu, etc.).",

Emergency contraceptive pills can significantly alter the normal menstrual cycle, so your next period could come earlier or later than expected. It is difficult to predict when it will arrive.\n3. Emergency contraceptive pills are over 95% effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within 24 hours, so the likelihood of pregnancy is relatively low. You will only know if you are pregnant if you miss your next period and take a pregnancy test.\n4. Frequently taking emergency contraceptive pills can disrupt your menstrual cycle and have a negative impact on your body. Please take care and consider using other methods of contraception.",

Based on your medical history, it appears that you may have sustained some minor trauma while carrying wood, which could have led to bleeding in the tissue, forming a collection of blood (hematoma). Typically, smaller blood collections get absorbed on their own. However, in your case, blood clotting may be hampered by the blood thinners you are taking, and this could also lead to an infected abscess, causing more pain. If I were your doctor, I would advise consulting the physician who prescribed your blood thinners to consider temporarily discontinuing them until the bruise heals. If it does not improve, I would refer you to a general surgeon for a clinical examination and further management. I hope this information helps you discuss your concerns with your family physician or treating doctor. Please feel free to ask any additional questions. Wishing you a speedy recovery.",
    "810": "Based on the information provided, there are several risks associated with cardiac disease that are relevant to your situation. Firstly, your age of 64 puts you at a higher risk for cardiac diseases. Secondly, stress is another risk factor that you have identified as potentially contributing to your symptoms. Additionally, the fact that you are taking medication for high blood pressure indicates that you have hypertension, which itself is a risk factor for cardiac disease.\n\nGiven these factors, I would advise you to monitor your blood pressure at least three times per day and take steps to reduce your risk factors for cardiac disease. This could include lifestyle modifications such as exercise and diet changes, as well as managing stress through relaxation techniques or other methods.\n\nIt would also be prudent to get a baseline ECG done for safety reasons, as this can help to identify any underlying cardiac abnormalities that may be contributing to your symptoms.

    "815": "Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. After reviewing your history, I would like to make the following suggestions for you: 1. I typically prescribe montelukast and levocetirizine to patients with your condition. Additionally, I also recommend an albuterol inhaler to be used on an as-needed basis for wheezing. If your symptoms are more frequent, I may also add regular inhaled corticosteroids to your current medication regimen. 2. I would also recommend allergy testing for common airborne substances such as house dust mites, molds, pollen, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help identify the substances that are causing your allergies and provide information on how to avoid them. 3. Based on the results of your allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe allergen-specific immunotherapy which works to gradually improve your allergies by targeting your immune system. 4. In general, I recommend avoiding exposure to dusts, smokes, and air pollution as much as possible. 5. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals can also help improve your lung capacity and immunity in the long run. 6. Since you have difficulty with sports, I suggest using an albuterol inhaler 15-20 minutes before sports activities to prevent exercise-induced wheezing. I hope these suggestions are helpful to you.

    "822": "Hello! Thank you for your question. It is difficult to determine the exact cause of cancer. Some cases of kidney cancer are genetic (accounting for a small percentage), while others may be related to smoking, obesity, estrogens, and certain chemical agents. However, many people smoke and do not develop kidney cancer, so it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. Cancer generally arises from a single cell mutation that is not detected by the immune system. Once this mutation occurs, the cell's growth and spread become uncontrolled, leading to the development of cancer. This process cannot be stopped by the human body, which is the main challenge with cancer. Additionally, many types of cancer do not present any symptoms, making it difficult to detect and diagnose the disease. I hope this information helps. Regards.",

If you have regular periods despite this high prolactin level, then there is nothing to worry about. However, if you have irregular periods, I suggest visiting an endocrinologist for further evaluation. Additionally, if your husband has normospermia and you have undergone all necessary investigations related to conception with normal results, then you have a high chance of getting pregnant.

    "827": "Hello Miss. Ankita, I have gone through your problem. You have mentioned that your GOT and SGPT levels are high. You didn't mention any symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, or vomiting. GOT and SGPT are liver enzymes present in liver cells (Hepatocytes). When there is destruction of liver cells, these enzymes are released into the blood circulation. These high levels can be seen when we perform a Liver function test on the patient. Now you need to know the reasons for liver cell destruction. Some common causes are: 1. Viral hepatitis, 2. Cirrhosis of the liver, 3. Alcoholic hepatitis. Usually, in viral hepatitis, the liver enzymes will return to normal levels after a few days of conservative treatment. However, in alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver, there will be continuous liver cell damage and these enzymes may remain elevated. You should consult your physician or Gastroenterologist and follow their advice. You need further evaluation with an Ultrasound scan of the abdomen to check the status of the liver and gallbladder. It's always safe to avoid surgery until the liver enzymes return to normal levels. I wish you good luck.",

    "839": "Hi, There could be a number of possible causes for your symptoms, and treatment may vary depending on the underlying cause. However, the general approach to treatment remains similar. I suspect that you may have contact dermatitis, which is a rash on the skin that can be itchy, painful, or tender, and sometimes causes blisters or swelling. Contact dermatitis can be caused by either an irritant or an allergen that comes into contact with the skin. Common substances that can cause contact dermatitis include soaps, perfumes, rubber products, cosmetics, jewelry, and medications. To avoid further contact dermatitis, it is important to identify and avoid the substance that is causing the reaction, if possible. Treatment for contact dermatitis typically involves the use of corticosteroid skin creams or other topical ointments. If the rash is severe, your doctor may also prescribe oral medications. Applying cool, wet compresses to the affected area or taking a cool bath can also help to alleviate symptoms. It is important to avoid scratching the rash, wearing rough clothing, or continuing to come into contact with the irritant or allergen, as this can worsen the rash. I hope this information is helpful, and I wish you a speedy recovery. Best wishes.",

To relieve your symptoms, you can try gargling with lukewarm saline water two to three times a day, avoiding gum irritants such as tobacco-containing products, and gently massaging your gums with the pulp of your finger in a circular motion. You can also apply an ointment like Stolon and take vitamin B and C supplements after consulting with your doctor.

If you also suffer from frequent urination and burning when urinating, it could be a UTI. If your pain worsens when coughing and there is a lump in the groin, a hernia is possible. Your nausea could be caused by one of the mentioned diseases or could be caused by peptic ulcer, acid reflux, or bile duct stones. It is advisable for you to have an abdominal ultrasound, full blood work with liver tests (AST, ALT, GTP), pancreas amylase, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test. Upper GI endoscopy might also be necessary. I hope this helps. Regards.",
    "844": "Hello, Welcome to ChatDoctor. I understand your concerns. You are experiencing post-fever tiredness and fatigue. It may take 2-3 weeks for you to recover from these symptoms. Since you had a fever three weeks ago, it may have decreased your body's immunity, and it typically takes about three weeks after recovering from a fever to rebuild your immunity. Therefore, I would recommend the following: 1. Get adequate rest and sound sleep. 2. Consume plenty of fruits and vegetables, which are rich in vitamins. 3. Stay hydrated by drinking enough water throughout the day. I hope this information addresses your concerns. Thank you for consulting ChatDoctor.",

As a Gastroenterologist, I can tell you that there are many reasons why your SGPT level may be elevated other than alcohol consumption, such as Hepatitis B and C virus, Wilson disease, and autoimmune liver disease.

    "847": "There are two possibilities. One could be a viral infection like the flu, given your aching body and sneezing. However, if you have been sneezing for a few months, this could be a sign of allergic rhinitis. Sometimes the lining of your nose might be inflamed, and vigorous nose blowing can cause bleeding. If the mucus from your nose remains blood-stained even after you recover, it's worth getting an opinion from an ENT specialist. Have you tried taking regular antihistamines for your ongoing sneezing, such as Levocetirizine 10mg daily?",

However, prior to the transplant, HCV treatment and a liver biopsy are necessary to ensure the liver is healthy. The chances of a successful transplant are good, and this is not an uncommon situation.\n2. I recommend thrice-weekly dialysis in your case, as studies have shown that patients who undergo thrice-weekly dialysis have better outcomes post-transplant compared to those on a twice-weekly schedule.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
    "851": "Hi, thank you for providing a brief history. Given the pain and swelling in the leg and feet after the stent procedure, I believe a thorough clinical examination of the limbs and heart is necessary. Additionally, since the stent improves venous blood flow, it is important to re-evaluate the cardiac and venous systems. Pain and swelling should not occur after the stent procedure, but if they do, a thorough examination can help determine if any other blood clots are compromising blood flow.

Regular sleep and a healthy diet can help with your physical and emotional well-being. Spending time with friends and loved ones can also lift your mood and help you feel more connected.\n\nIf you are struggling with depression or negative thoughts, it may be helpful to speak with a psychiatrist for a more thorough assessment and treatment plan.

    "857": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. I have reviewed your case and I share your concern. Typically, an allergic cough is not related to lung issues, but if proper treatment is not received, it can affect the lung tissue. Based on your case, it appears that your child may have a weakened immune system, which makes them susceptible to climate changes or specific items such as food or sprays. It is important to identify the exact allergen causing the problem. In the meantime, I recommend consulting a homeopathic physician and giving your child 4-5 almonds daily in the morning with milk. This should provide a solution to the problem. Best regards, Chat Doctor.",

To diagnose the issue, a clinical examination by a general surgeon would be necessary. This may be followed by high resolution ultrasonography or MRI for confirmation. In selected cases, fine needle aspiration (FNAC) may also be required. Once a proper diagnosis is made, an appropriate management plan can be put in place, whether it be surgical or medical intervention. I hope this answers your question.

    "861": "Hello, welcome to our chat. I have thoroughly evaluated your query and can understand your concerns about your mother's health. Given her advanced stage of tuberculosis and pneumonia, as well as the destruction of her right lung, it is clear that she is in a critical condition. Her difficulty breathing without oxygen support and low oxygen levels further exacerbate her situation.\n\nAt this stage, a lung transplant may not be a viable option for your mother, especially considering the limitations and challenges associated with such a procedure. Currently, lung transplants are not widely practiced in India, and even if they were, your mother's advanced age and comorbidities may make her an unsuitable candidate.\n\nInstead, the focus should be on providing her with symptomatic supportive treatment to alleviate her discomfort and improve her quality of life as much as possible. This may include managing her breathing with oxygen support, administering medications to manage any associated symptoms, and ensuring she receives proper nutrition and care.\n\nI understand your desperation to find a solution for your mother's condition, but unfortunately, at this stage, a lung transplant may not be a realistic option. I wish you and your family strength and support during this difficult time. Regards.",

It's important to note that there could be many reasons for this fear, and it's possible that there may be underlying factors that have contributed to her anxiety.\n\nWhile it's comforting to know that your daughter is doing well in school and has a social life, it's important to address her fear and anxiety as it could potentially impact her mental health and well-being in the long run. I would recommend consulting a child psychologist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders in children. They would be able to assess your daughter's situation and provide appropriate treatment recommendations.\n\nIn the meantime, it may be helpful to continue with your nighttime routine and avoid giving her caffeinated or sugary foods before bed.

Some centers also offer shockwave therapy as a treatment option to break up the stone. This should give you enough time to electively schedule surgery for May if needed.

If you are experiencing swelling and pain, you can immobilize your finger to allow proper rest for the joint. Apply a crepe bandage for support and compression, and use ice packs to reduce swelling, inflammation, and pain. Physiotherapy with ultrasound and TENS can also be beneficial. For early healing, you can take Tab Colin [it C] and antioxidants with anti-inflammatory properties [Tab Enzymic Plus]. If there is no improvement, you may need to consider an MRI.

I understand that you are currently taking the medication Rifampicin, Isoniazid, and Rimactazid, and you are wondering about the dos and don'ts of your condition, as well as your infectiousness.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is crucial that you do not stop using your anti-tubercular treatment without talking to your doctor. It is essential to complete the prescribed course of medication to ensure that the infection clears up.\n\nRegarding your current symptoms of cough and colds, it is possible that you may be infectious. However, the negativity of your sputum result 3 months ago suggests that you were not producing sputum at that time, which reduces the likelihood of you spreading the infection.

I recommend that you avoid eating or drinking anything orally and seek immediate medical attention.

    "912": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. You are most likely experiencing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) due to the incisional hernia, which has caused the gastroesophageal sphincter to become lax. As a result, stomach acid tends to flow up into the esophagus, leading to symptoms such as a gaseous feeling, bloating, chest tightness, and pressure. The gaseous distention of the stomach can also prevent the lungs from expanding fully, which is why you may feel shortness of breath. To help alleviate these symptoms, I recommend the following steps: 1. Reduce stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy foods. 3. Opt for small, frequent meals instead of large ones. 4. Take proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for a walk after meals. 6. Use 2-3 pillows under your head while sleeping to prevent reflux. If you do not see an improvement after making these lifestyle changes, you may require surgical correction for the incisional hernia.",

You will also need to undergo further investigations, such as a routine hologram, RBS, and an ultrasound of the pelvis. A transrectal sonography of the prostate may be necessary if needed.

    "916": "Hello, your symptoms may be related to gastric problems such as indigestion and stasis, which can sometimes cause fermentation and flatulence, leading to abdominal distension. Recurrent gastrointestinal infections may also be a reason for abdominal distension. Please get checked by a physician and have investigations done if necessary.

This liquefaction process is necessary for the sperm to swim effectively. Delayed liquefaction may indicate a problem with the prostate, seminal vesicles, or bulb urethral glands, which are part of the male reproductive system. Therefore, I recommend consulting a urologist or infertility specialist for further evaluation and treatment.

    "924": "Hello! I have read your concern about your back pain and gastric problem. There could be various reasons for your back pain such as age, lifestyle, diet, work exertion, poor posture, lack of exercise, and menstruation or menopause in women. To alleviate your back stress, make sure you maintain proper posture when sitting, standing, and bending. A well-balanced, easily digestible diet rich in fibers, fish, fruits, vegetables, vitamins, and minerals is essential for your overall health. If you're not getting enough nutrients from your diet, you may face various health issues. As a remedy, you can try antioxidants, lemon juice with water and a pinch of salt and pepper, aloe vera juice with AMLA juice, papaya, coconut water, ginger, garlic, and fenugreek powder with water. Turmeric powder with hot milk before bedtime may also help. Avoid fried foods, tea, coffee, alcohol, smoking, mental stress, worry, and anxiety. Additionally, ensure proper bowel movements as constipation can lead to various health problems. For proper blood circulation, regular walking, front bending exercises, yoga, and pranayam (deep breathing) are beneficial. Adequate rest and sound sleep are crucial for detoxifying and strengthening your immune system. Always adopt the right posture when sitting, standing, and bending. Avoid front bending exercises as they can worsen your situation. Instead, opt for back bending exercises like Bhujangasan, Khanpur San, and Sheratan, which are effective in relieving back pain. Sleep on a hard bed for better support. If you have any further questions or doubts, feel free to reach out to ChatDoctor.com. Take care and all the best!",
    "925": "Hello, Thank you for your inquiry. The symptoms you mentioned can be seen in early pregnancy. However, as they can also be seen in other conditions, such as gastric disturbances and hormonal imbalances, they are not specific to pregnancy.

Meanwhile, you can take symptomatic treatment such as antacids and antiemetics. Take care.",

This pinching can occur for a variety of reasons and to determine the cause, an MRI scan of your lower back or lumbosacral spine would be necessary.

    "930": "Thank you for your question on HealthTap. I understand your concern. No, these symptoms are not due to thickening of the blood. Since you have a heart murmur, we should definitely rule out arrhythmia (heart rhythm disturbances) in your case. So, consult a cardiologist and get the following tests done: 1. ECG, 2. 2D echo, and 3. Holter monitoring (24-hour continuous recording of ECG). If all these tests are normal, then there is no need to worry about arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Sometimes uncontrolled stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So, avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. I hope I have answered your query. I will be happy to help you further.

However, since you haven't had your period, it is difficult to predict if you are pregnant. The only way to confirm pregnancy is through a urine pregnancy test or an ultrasound.

In younger patients, a metabolic cause such as hyperthyroidism could be the reason. In older patients, possibilities could include essential tremor, a degenerative disease, or a stroke. However, the gradual onset of your tremor makes a stroke less likely. A positive family history of tremor would support a diagnosis of essential tremor. Sleep apnea can cause tremor in the hands during the day, but it would improve with proper treatment of apnea. Therefore, I would advise you to consult a neurologist and have a full blood test and thyroid function tests done. If the results of these tests are normal, a brain MRI may be helpful.

    "976": "Hello, welcome to the forum. These are common newborn issues that parents have to go through. There are a number of reasons why a baby will cry. They are still in the adjusting phase to the external environment. Most small babies cry for between one hour and three hours each day. Your baby can't do anything for herself and relies on you to provide her with food, warmth, and comfort. Crying is your baby's way of communicating any or all of those needs and ensuring a response from you. It's sometimes hard to work out what your baby is telling you. But in time you will learn to recognize what your baby needs. And as your baby grows, she'll learn other ways of communicating with you, such as making eye contact, making noises, and smiling, all of which reduce her need to cry for attention. I usually refer to them as 7 reasons for a baby to cry: hunger, a wet diaper, too cold or too hot environment, need to be held close, need rest, need something to make them feel better, and furthermore, need something but they don't know what. Slowly, you will learn to answer these questions for your baby. If a child cries constantly for more than 6 hours for no obvious reasons, then they should be seen by a doctor.",

In addition to taking Fefol-Z, increasing your intake of green leafy vegetables, fruit juices, and cereals for protein can also be beneficial. When trying to conceive, having sex between the 10th and 20th day of the menstrual cycle in the male-up position and lying down for at least 15 minutes after sex can also increase the chances of conception. Wishing you the best of luck for a quick result and a beautiful baby.",
    "990": "Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Since you are not showing any visible ulcers or growth, the possibility of oral cancer is very low in your case. The painful sensation you are feeling is mostly due to nerve hypersensitivity in that area. Tobacco locally irritates the mucosa, causing nerves in that area to become hypersensitive and cause painful sensations. So you need to quit tobacco as soon as possible. Start taking a multivitamin tablet containing folic acid, niacin, vitamin B12, and zinc. All of these are helpful in nerve regeneration. So discuss all of these with your doctor. I hope I have answered your question. Wishing you good health. Thank you.",

    "992": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Your symptoms appear to be similar to those of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by infrequent and irregular periods, as well as abnormal ovulation. This condition is caused by a disruption in the pituitary-thyroid-ovarian axis, which can lead to hormonal imbalances. To better understand your condition, it is important to have a thorough discussion and follow a systematic treatment plan. Preferably, ayurvedic treatment can be considered for hormonal correction to avoid potential complications in the future. Take care and chat with Doctor again if needed.",
    "993": "Dear member, Thank you for writing. You have not mentioned your own and your husband's age. As age increases, the chances of poor ovarian response to fertility treatments also increase. Are your husband's semen parameters normal? A laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, along with checking the patency of the fallopian tubes, can provide a clearer picture of your fertility status. If all test results, including blood tests for ovarian reserve, are normal and you have undergone five to six cycles of fertility treatments with no success, then in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) may be an option to consider. Please remain hopeful. Infertility treatment requires patience from both the patient and the doctor. Please feel free to write back if you have any further questions.",
    "994": "Doctor's response: Thank you for bringing your daughter's injury to our attention. Based on your description, it is possible that she has sustained a fracture or severe musculoskeletal injury. I advise you to seek immediate medical attention from an orthopedic surgeon who can properly examine and manage her condition. They may recommend an X-ray of her leg to investigate any potential fractures. To assist with transportation, you may consider splinting the affected area with a board. You can provide pain relief with acetaminophen or ibuprofen tablets. If you have any further health-related questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Take care.",
    "997": "Hello, welcome to consult a doctor. I have read your question and understand your concern. For psoriasis, a variety of topical and oral medications are available. For limited psoriasis, you may use moderate to high-potency steroidal lotion on the affected scalp until the lesions clear up. Additionally, for scalp washes, coal tar preparations with ketoconazole are recommended. For extensive psoriasis, consideration should be given to starting methotrexate tablets. You may discuss my opinion with your dermatologist. Stay healthy.",
    "998": "Hello and welcome to ChatDoctor. I would like to inform you that periodontitis is an inflammation of the periodontium, which are the tissues that support the teeth. It's possible that you underwent scaling and root planing, which involves the removal of plaque and calculus, resulting in empty spaces and loosening of teeth. This is quite natural after scaling, so there is no need to worry. I recommend starting with gum massage with some gum paint like Rexidine-M gel for 15 minutes, twice a day. Additionally, use a 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash 10ml half an hour after brushing once daily. These measures will definitely help you. However, if your problem persists, talk to your dentist about periodontal flap surgery, as it's also a good option in severe cases. Make sure to maintain proper oral hygiene by regular brushing and interdental flossing to clean those gaps. Best regards, ChatDoctor.",
    "999": "Hi! You didn't mention if you ate anything from an outside shop one or two days before. Most likely, you have food poisoning due to ingesting stale/infected food. Any kind of infection in the body will cause fever, headache, and body ache with variation in your body temperature. If fever troubles you, then you should take a paracetamol/acetaminophen tablet. The hot and cold flushes you get could be due to excessive sympathetic activity. Your treating family physician may advise you to get a routine test of your stool or blood sample apart from prescribing you an appropriate antibiotic and some anti-spasmodic if the abdominal pain is severe enough to warrant it. If you experience nausea/vomiting, which you might, then take an anti-emetic. At the same time, maintain your hydration. If the pain increases and you do not get relief even after these efforts, then you should consult a general surgeon, who may advise you to get an ultrasound and other necessary tests which can be decided only when he examines you.

However, it does have side effects as the pill contains hormones which can alter the menstrual cycle for a couple of months. Therefore, it should only be used as emergency contraception and not as a regular method. My advice to you is to use a condom as it is highly effective in preventing pregnancy and also protects against sexually transmitted diseases. I hope that answers your question.",

It can also lead to infection and inflammation of the tonsils, resulting in tonsillitis and a sore throat. Therefore, it is important for you to consult an oral physician to evaluate and determine the underlying cause of the thrush. Treating the underlying cause can help resolve the thrush.

    "1018": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. While surgeries in the neck region have a higher success rate, in 10 to 20 percent of patients the pain can return after surgery and become troublesome. Although surgical procedures may relieve pressure on nerve roots in strategic locations, patients may still complain of severe neck pain postoperatively. The reason is that the affected nerve roots are still under pressure in areas other than where surgical manipulation has been performed. You may consider repeat surgery, but it also has limitations after a fusion procedure. Please discuss non-surgical options such as radiofrequency techniques and targeted nerve root blocks. These are temporary measures and may require repeat sessions annually. Please encourage your husband by letting him know that many people experience pain even after surgery, similar to what he has experienced. Treatment is just around the corner, and I believe that undergoing a scan will reveal any new developments that can be addressed to alleviate his pain.",

In your case, I only see a family history of heart disease along with overweight features. So I would go ahead and prescribe Qsymia if I were treating you.

Pancreatic cancer is a severe condition with a poor prognosis, and survival time is often limited to months or a few years at most, unless detected at an early stage.

In India, cannabis is a prohibited substance, and obtaining it may be difficult. Additionally, the quality and purity of the cannabis may not be suitable for medical use. I recommend that your friend obtain medical-grade cannabis with a prescription if possible and proceed with treatment under medical supervision.",

However, to further confirm the absence of ischemic coronary artery disease, you can consider undergoing an echocardiography test.

A chest X-ray is needed to rule out lung infection, while PFT is essential for the diagnosis of bronchitis.

    "1034": "Hello, thank you for writing in. The collecting system of the kidney consists of renal calyces and the pelvis, which collects the urine formed in the kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting the kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. The pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects to the upper end of the ureter. I assume you have had an ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney. This is a term used to describe an increase in the diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. This is not a critical situation, so please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. Since it is described as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, it could be due to your bladder being completely full at the time of the ultrasound scan, or your kidney pelvicalyceal system may naturally appear full (extrarenal pelvis), which is an extension of a normal appearance. Rarely, an infection of the urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms such as pain in the kidney region, problems such as burning urination or discoloration of urine, or any history of kidney infections. Stones in the kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of the pelvicalyceal system, but since you do not have any stones, this does not apply to you. It is important to know if your scan was repeated after urinating and there was still persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on the left side. This can also be confirmed by doing an IVP, which involves injecting a contrast agent and taking 5 to 6 X-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. Please consult a urologist for further evaluation and advice.",

To confirm the diagnosis, you may need to undergo an ultrasound of both kidneys, a physical examination and stool examination for amoeba history, or an ultrasound of both ovaries. In my opinion, it would be best to consult a gastroenterologist for their opinion as you have been experiencing this pain for 15 days. Good luck.",
    "1039": "Hi, thanks for reaching out. Since allergies have been ruled out, there are a few other possible causes for your sneezing. These include sinus problems or vasomotor rhinitis. I recommend consulting an ENT doctor for an examination, as a nasal endoscopy would be useful to check for sinus issues. If sinus problems are ruled out, the likely cause is vasomotor rhinitis, which is caused by the dilation of blood vessels in the nose.\n\nTo manage your symptoms, you can try using a saline nasal spray or decongestants. If these measures don't help, your doctor may prescribe corticosteroid nasal sprays or antihistamine nasal sprays. If you have a deviated septum, correcting it may also help prevent future occurrences.\n\nIdentifying triggers that cause your symptoms can also be helpful. Common triggers include perfumes, secondhand smoke, and dust. Avoiding these triggers can reduce your discomfort and symptoms. Additionally, be cautious about overusing nasal decongestants.

It's possible that due to sudden movements during the accident, you may have injured your neck, which is where the nerves supplying the hand and wrist originate. It's not uncommon for pain to start a day after a minor traumatic incident. The muscles may go into spasm due to the release of small amounts of neural transmitters, which can cause pain. This is why you may be experiencing more pain on the second day. Applying ointments containing pain relievers and muscle relaxants should help improve the situation over a week. Getting an X-ray of your cervical spine can also help confirm that your spine is normal and not a cause for concern.",

It's also important for you to see a surgeon or gynecologist for a clinical examination to rule out any intra-abdominal pathology or pelvic inflammatory disease. To help with your discomfort, I suggest avoiding eating food from outside your home to prevent any intestinal infections from unhygienically cooked food. The further management of your condition will depend on the results of the investigations and clinical examination. Please feel free to ask if you have any further questions. I hope this information helps you in discussing your health problems with your family physician or treating doctor. Wishing you a speedy recovery.",
    "1063": "Hi, Thanks for your query. The pain in your thighs and hips could be caused by a variety of issues, including problems with the spine, hip joint, or muscles in the thigh. A physical examination would be necessary to determine the likely source of the pain, and X-rays of the spine, hip, and femur may be helpful in further investigating the issue. Given the nature of your pain, it is possible that the problem is related to your hip joint or thigh muscles. If the pain is coming from your hip joint, osteoarthritis is a common diagnosis in people of your age. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Take care.",
    "1064": "Thanks for sharing your concern. I understand that you have been going through a stressful time for the past 2 months due to erectile dysfunction (ED) and associated weight loss. Despite getting tested and being reassured by two doctors that you are in good health, the anxiety and fear of rejection by your partner or wife can contribute to the persistent ED.\n\nTo help manage your symptoms, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Consult a Urologist for a detailed clinical examination to rule out any anatomical changes or defects that could be causing the ED.\n2. Start doing perineal exercises, which involve stopping and starting the flow of urine while urinating 4-5 times. This exercise helps strengthen the muscles and sphincters involved in erection and ejaculation.\n3. Include milk and milk products, ghee, cheese, curd, black grapes, pears, raisins, dates, almonds, walnuts, pomegranates, carrots, bananas, apricots, musk melons, AMLA, coconuts, pistachios, turnips, potatoes, onions, ladyfingers, radishes, old brown rice, peas, and garlic in your diet.\n4. Avoid sour and cold substances, tobacco, brinjals, tandoori ROTC, red chilies, heavy and hard-to-digest foods, jaggery, and deep-fried foods.\n5. You can ask your doctor to prescribe non-hormonal and safe sexual stimulants like Ashwagandha churn, viola capsules, and Tented Forte tabletops to improve libido and alleviate anxiety associated with sexual desire.\n\nAdditionally, I recommend getting evaluated by a Cardiologist to assess any potential risks of cardiovascular events before starting any new medication, especially for ED. Ayurveda medicines and herbs can also be incorporated into your daily routine after consultation with a qualified practitioner.\n\nRemember that stress and anxiety can significantly impact sexual function, so it's essential to address these issues holistically. Try to prioritize self-care activities like regular exercise, sufficient sleep, a balanced diet, and stress-management techniques like meditation or deep breathing exercises. If you continue to experience difficulties or have any further questions, please don't hesitate to consult a healthcare professional for guidance.",
    "1065": "Hello, Thank you for your question. Your boyfriend is experiencing erectile dysfunction since he sustained a spine injury from the car accident.

    "1068": "Hello, I have reviewed your case. Based on your symptoms and findings, it appears that you have osteoarthritis in your knee. I recommend starting cartilage-protecting medication, such as Chen Chat Doctor. It would be advisable to get an X-ray of your knee, and if necessary, an MRI can also be done. Physiotherapy treatments like ultrasound and TENS can be helpful, along with knee exercises. Making certain lifestyle changes can also help reduce pain, including:\n\n1. Load Reduction: Protecting the joint from excessive load can slow down cartilage loss and help relieve pain. If you are overweight, reducing your weight can be beneficial. Wearing shock-absorbing shoes, avoiding activities like climbing stairs, and using a walking stick can also be helpful.\n2. Activity Modification: It's important to maintain as much activity and joint motion as possible, but high-impact activities can aggravate arthritis. Running and jumping may accelerate cartilage loss in the joint, so it's best to focus on low-impact activities like swimming or cycling.\n3. Using Canes: Assistive devices can make it easier to move around without stressing your painful joint. A cane can help take weight off your knee or hip as you walk. Be sure to carry the cane in the hand opposite the leg that hurts.\n4. Analgesic Medication: Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen can often be sufficient for pain relief. If this doesn't control the pain, your doctor may prescribe a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).",

    "1078": "Lower back pain with radiation to the legs and muscle spasms in the legs suggest acute spinal disc disease. In the initial stages, conservative treatment is all that is required.

This means that ovulation occurs on day 14-15 (count the first day as the day on which bleeding begins, i.e. the start of the period). The size, as mentioned, must be 19-20mm of the dominant follicle, which matures and releases the ovum. The endometrial thickness should be 11mm. I hope this information is helpful for you.

    "1080": "Hi, thanks for reaching out. Stage IV colon cancer involves the spread of cancer to other organs such as the liver and lungs, and this occurs in about half of patients with colon cancer. The treatment for stage IV colon cancer typically includes surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given before surgery), local ablation (such as radiofrequency ablation), adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given after surgery), and intra-arterial chemotherapy (chemotherapy delivered directly to the tumor through an artery). The choice of treatment for metastasis is guided by certain criteria that determine which methods are most appropriate. Survival in this situation depends on the patient's overall condition and ensuring they receive adequate nutrition and a good diet. While a complete cure may not always be possible in stage IV colon cancer, it's important to continue fighting the cancer and providing support. With chemotherapy, survival in cases of metastasis can range from 6 months to over 2 years if the disease remains stable.

However, at 38 years old and with a normal/low blood pressure, non-smoking status, and normal ECG results, the likelihood of you having a heart attack is low, especially for a female.\n\nYour symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, and nausea, could be attributed to panic attacks or anxiety. Constantly worrying about getting a serious illness can lead to increased anxiety and panic attacks.\n\nTo manage your symptoms, I recommend trying relaxation exercises and breathing exercises to reduce anxiety levels. If these methods do not provide improvement, then medicinal treatment may be necessary. Commonly used medications for anxiety include Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).",
    "1133": "Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. There are several possibilities for the lump on the inner side of your feet, and all of them are benign or inflammatory, so there is no need to worry. However, proper investigation is necessary. The lump could be caused by unnoticed injury or pressure, resulting in friction of the skin and subsequent edema or hematoma. It could also be an epidermal or parasitic cyst, or possibly a ganglion or bursa. To confirm the diagnosis, you should consult a doctor for examination and possibly undergo tests such as FNAC. I hope this answers your question. If you have any additional questions or follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to write to us. Wishing you good health.",
    "1134": "Hello, She has two main issues which need attention - She is 17 years old and is staying away from home for the first time, and she has witnessed an accident. She has complaints of fever almost daily on a regular basis, but all investigations and examinations came back normal. Most likely, she is either having a problem of homesickness which is causing severe anxiety and is precipitating somatic symptoms like fever. The fever is nothing but weakness and chronic fatigue which is being perceived as fever. The other possibility is PTSD (Post-traumatic stress disorder), which develops after witnessing some serious life-threatening accident or event. After the event, individuals develop symptoms of anxiety and hyperarousal. I would advise you to consult a Psychiatrist for treatment and management. Behavior therapy, medicines like Fluoxetine, Sertraline which are good anti-anxiety and antidepressants are used in treatment. Consult a psychiatrist. Thanks, hope this helps you.",
    "1135": "Hello, Thank you for your question. It is possible that you are pregnant, but it is also possible that your period is simply late. It is too early to take a pregnancy test at this point as pregnancy tests are most accurate when taken after a missed period. I recommend waiting a few more days and if your period does not arrive, then take a pregnancy test. If the test is negative and you still have not had your period, I suggest speaking with your doctor or a healthcare provider for further evaluation.",
    "1136": "Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Let me address your concerns regarding Boniva. Boniva belongs to a class of medications called bisphosphonates, which work by slowing down or stopping the breakdown of bone. This helps increase bone density and reduces the risk of fractures.\n\nBoniva is taken as a monthly pill or injection. After taking one pill, it stays in your system and continues working for the full month before the next dose. It is important to take it as prescribed by your doctor to ensure effective treatment.\n\nOther options for treating osteoporosis include other bisphosphonates, such as Fosamax and Actonel. These medications work similarly to Boniva but may have different dosing instructions and side effects.\n\nIn addition to medication, vitamin D and calcium supplementation are important for maintaining bone health. Regular exercise, such as weight-bearing activities and strength training, can also help improve bone density.\n\nI hope this information helps alleviate some of your concerns about Boniva and osteoporosis treatment. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Wishing you good health.",
    "1139": "\"Hi, Thanks for your question on ChatDoctor. I do understand your pain and discomforts. Based on your history, I suggest checking your fasting blood sugar and Hemoglobin levels.

After getting the report, you may consult with any neurologist. Hope that helps.\"",
    "1142": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding your health concerns. I understand that you are a 63-year-old male, 5'5\" tall, with a history of diabetes that you manage through diet and testing. You also mentioned that you have had high triglycerides most of your life and are currently being treated for it, with good blood test results.\n\nThe issue you are experiencing with hard, crystal-like forms throughout your body, starting in your feet, legs, arms, back, ribs, and scalp, is concerning. You mentioned that you have tried breaking them up by rubbing the skin tissue with a hard object, which is quite painful. You also mentioned that if you don't break them up, the muscle tissue gets hard or seems to seize up.\n\nWhile it's possible that these crystal-like forms could be related to gout, the fact that your tests came back negative for gout suggests that there may be another underlying cause. Based on your symptoms and medical history, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Adopt a low-fat, vegetable-rich diet to help lower your triglycerides and improve your overall health.\n2. Reduce your consumption of eggs and non-vegetarian red meat, as these foods are high in saturated fats that can contribute to high triglycerides.\n3. Start treatment for lowering your high triglycerides, as this may help alleviate some of the symptoms you are experiencing.\n4. Treat your diabetes, as this may also help lower your blood fat levels and improve your overall health.\n5. Incorporate regular exercise into your routine, such as jogging at home and walking for at least 30 minutes a day.\n\nPlease send me copies of your triglyceride blood test and blood sugar reports so that I can better understand your current health status and help you find a solution to your crystal-like form issue. Additionally, please send any other relevant blood test reports and records.\n\nThank you for reaching out to me, and I look forward to helping you address your health concerns as soon as possible.

    "1143": "Hi, Thank you for writing in. I understand your concern about the malar rash caused by photosensitivity. It's important to continue with your current medication, including Hydrochloroquine tablets and Momate cream, as prescribed by your doctor. It's also good to know that you're using a sunblock with Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Octocrylene, and Zinc Oxide to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays. However, it's crucial to have routine checkups to monitor your hemoglobin and ANA profile levels. Additionally, since Hydrochloroquine can have side effects on the eyes, it's essential to get your eyes examined every six months. I recommend visiting a qualified dermatologist or physician for proper treatment and follow-up. They may adjust your medication or suggest additional treatments to help improve your condition. Keep in mind that treatment for lupus and photosensitivity can vary depending on the individual. I hope this information helps, and please feel free to ask any further questions.

    "1151": "Hello, Thank you for your question. In simpler terms, your MRI results indicate that a fibrous band in your knee joint is torn, and your medial collateral ligament (MCL), which stabilizes your knee joint and holds your bones in place, is sprained. There is also an excessive amount of fluid collected around or within your knee joint, and the cartilage under your kneecap is damaged. As a result, the bones in your thigh and leg are rubbing against each other at the knee joint. Yes, you do require surgical repair to prevent further damage and regain normal function.

    "1152": "Hello, thanks for your question. Excessive masturbation cannot cause any harmful effects to your penis and does not actually lead to a reduction in penis size. However, it can make you extremely tired and lead to premature ejaculation. If you are healthy and do not have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, you do not need to worry about the size. It is better to avoid any sexual activity or masturbation for a couple of weeks and then look for improvement. If it still does not improve, you need to get a health check to see if there is anything wrong with you. I hope this answers your question. Regards",
    "1154": "Hi, thanks for contacting Chat Doctor. I have noted that you have had multiple surgeries. You haven't mentioned the reason for your hysterectomy or parotid removal, and it could potentially be related to malignancy. Regarding your parotid, it might be a malignant tumor, so further investigation is needed. For the lump on your collarbone, a Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) test should be done, and if the results are suspicious, a biopsy should be conducted to check for malignancy. If your previous surgeries were related to malignancy, then it might be metastasis, which means the spread of residual cancer cells. Therefore, you should consult a surgeon for further evaluation.

    "1155": "Hello, I understand your concern. Based on your history, you missed one pill. If it's only been 24 hours since you missed the pill, take two tablets simultaneously (the missed tablet and that day's tablet together). This will help prevent pregnancy, and continue taking the remaining tablets regularly. In this case, there is no need for the Plan B pill. However, if 24 hours have passed and you did not take the missed pill, you should take Plan B as early as possible or within 72 hours after sex to prevent pregnancy. I hope this helps you.

    "1156": "Hello, Thank you for your question. Based on the information you have provided, it seems that you are an intelligent individual but unfortunately, you are focusing too much on matters that are not of great importance in day-to-day life. The itching and redness on your glans that occurs after masturbation is most likely due to an infection caused by contamination. I recommend that you take a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as Definite, along with an anti-inflammatory medication like Chat Doctor. Additionally, you should apply a topical antibiotic ointment such as Newsprint twice daily. Many of your concerns appear to be related to anxiety. It would be beneficial for you to consult with a qualified psychiatrist for counseling. To reduce the frequency of masturbation, try to keep yourself busy with activities like sports, reading, or social work so that you have less free time to engage in this behavior.",
    "1159": "Dear patient, I understand that you suffered two compression fractures in the middle of your back in July and that you are currently wearing a back brace for support at work. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well and are able to walk, despite the pain you are experiencing.\n\nThe changing weather can certainly affect your pain levels, as temperature and humidity can impact the way your body perceives and processes pain. It's difficult to predict exactly how long you will continue to feel uncomfortable, as everyone's recovery process is different. However, it's common for pain to persist for several months after a spinal injury, and it may be several more months before you notice a significant improvement.\n\nIn terms of pain management, I recommend continuing to take your prescribed pain medication as needed. If you run out of medication and are still experiencing pain, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. However, it's important to talk to your doctor before taking any new medications, especially if you have any concerns about potential side effects or interactions with other medications you are taking.\n\nIn addition to medication, there are other things you can do to manage your pain. For example, applying ice or heat to the affected area can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises can also help improve mobility and reduce pain over time. Your doctor or a physical therapist can recommend specific exercises that are safe and appropriate for you to do.",

    "1163": "Hi... Thank you for consulting with me. Cough and cold are usually viral in children. For cold, you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine, and for nasal congestion, saline nasal decongestants will help. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum dose of 500 mg) every 4-6 hours, but only if the fever is higher than 100F. I advise against using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. For the cold, you can give Cetirizine at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours for 3 days. For nasal congestion, plain saline nasal drops can be used 2-3 times a day. Additionally, I recommend giving your daughter plenty of fluids and offering her bland foods like rice, bread, and potatoes. Pedialyte can also be given to help replace lost electrolytes. If your daughter's symptoms worsen or persist for more than a week, please consult a pediatrician.",

I recommend sending a sample of your ejaculated semen to a lab for analysis. If the results show pus cells, antibiotics may be prescribed. If you are experiencing symptoms such as fever and weight loss, the semen should be tested for tuberculosis. If necessary, a culture can be done. An ultrasound of the abdomen may also be helpful. A transrectal palpation and ultrasound would be useful to rule out any issues with the prostate gland. In the meantime, I suggest maintaining a healthy and balanced diet, including plenty of fruits. Keep alcohol and smoking to a minimum. Please consult a surgeon and keep my response in mind. Take care.",

Pain in the vas deferens could be due to infection, medically known as orchitis if the infection is in the testis, or epididymitis if it is in the epididymis. This presents as pain and marked swelling in the affected area. Another possible diagnosis would be varicocele, which is the abnormal enlargement and dilation of the veins in the spermatic cord (the structure that connects the testis to the ejaculatory ducts located in the prostate). This presents as no swelling but enlargement of the spermatic cord, especially during straining and Valsalva maneuvers. This can be confirmed by performing a scrotal ultrasound with Doppler studies.

As you are a known case of allergies and are experiencing symptoms of allergies, for which you are taking medications and the symptoms are only improving with treatment. The triggering factor for allergy symptoms is exposure to allergens, which stimulate mast cells to release histamine and produce symptoms, evident by an increased eosinophil count. While these medications will help alleviate the symptoms, they will not cure the condition. I would recommend undergoing a skin prick test to identify the allergen causing the symptoms. Once the allergen is identified, you can opt for sublingual immunotherapy or subcutaneous immunotherapy. Thank you.",
    "1181": "Hello dear, even if conception has occurred, pregnancy will not have any symptoms at all on the next day of unprotected sex. Therefore, you cannot attribute your cramping to pregnancy. The pull-out method is not a reliable and safe method of contraception. Before ejaculation of the sperms, pre-seminal secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum does contain some sperms which can impregnate the woman. The earliest test you can perform for detection of pregnancy is a beta hCG test on your blood. This test gives reliable results 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse. Values greater than 25 mIU/mL are diagnostic of pregnancy, while in the non-pregnant state, the values remain under 5 mIU/mL. Alternatively, you may wait for your period to arrive. If you get your period, you are not pregnant. If you miss your period, perform a pregnancy test on an overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier tests may report false negatives. I hope this helps you today.",

In order to properly assess your symptoms, I recommend that you seek medical attention from a healthcare professional. This will allow for a thorough evaluation of your condition and appropriate diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, I suggest that you stop taking Valacyclovir and monitor your symptoms.

    "1186": "Hi, If the lump appeared after sclerotherapy, it is most likely a thrombosed vein. This means that a vein that was treated with sclerotherapy has a clot in it, which is the desired effect. Did you use any compression after the therapy? You should use compression to reduce swelling. If the lump is not red and painful, it does not require immediate medical attention. You should use compression in the form of a crêpe bandage or Class II compression stockings, and it should resolve with that. Otherwise, you can see your surgeon for further evaluation. Try not to worry, everything should be alright. Take care.",

    "1189": "Hello, any blood pressure medication may cause the blood pressure to drop too low, making people feel lightheaded. The only way to minimize this is to follow your doctor's advice and take one medication at a time, starting with a low dose, and evaluate its effectiveness in a few days to a week. A common side effect of Novas is that it works by dilating blood vessels, which can cause blood to pool in the feet and lead to puffy ankles. This is not a serious symptom.

    "1197": "Hi, Thanks for your question. I understand your concern. The meaning of the ultrasound scan results are as follows:\n\n1. Adequate fetal movements indicate that the baby is in good health and there are no negative effects from the nuchal cords.\n2. The placenta is in the anterior position, meaning it is attached to the front wall of the uterus, and it is not low-lying, which means it is in a safe place with no risk of placenta previa causing risks during delivery.\n3. Nuchal cord twice means that there are two rounds of the umbilical cord around the baby's neck. However, the baby is not affected, and there are no signs of early labor.\n4. The cervix is competent, meaning it has a normal length, and there is no risk of delivery in the coming days.\n\nOverall, while the nuchal cords are a sign of concern, the baby appears to be healthy and unaffected. The cords may resolve themselves, but we will continue to monitor the baby's well-being and the possibility of labor. Please show the report to your treating gynecologist for specific advice.",

When patients come to our hospital with similar symptoms, we recommend blood tests such as RA factor, CCP, ESR, complete blood count, HLA B27, and ANA. An MRI may also be required if necessary.

Based on your description of experiencing bad stomach pains after eating, an urge to go to the toilet, and blood in your stool, as well as a history of a carcinoid tumor, it's possible that you may be experiencing irritable bowel syndrome. However, to rule out the possibility of a cancer relapse, I recommend consulting a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. In the meantime, I advise following a diet that avoids spicy, junk, and oily foods to minimize irritation to your gut. I hope for a speedy recovery and wish you the best.",
    "1206": "Hi Zofran, As doctors, we treat the patient and their symptoms. It appears that your MRI report shows some signs of degeneration (wear and tear), but an MRI scan itself does not require any treatment! Please let me know what symptoms you are experiencing, how long you have had them, what medications you have taken and for how long, and whether they have provided any relief. This information will help me determine if the MRI report correlates with your symptoms and allow me to give you appropriate advice.",
    "1208": "I don't think there's any cause for concern, especially regarding the arteries. The duplex sonogram is a highly accurate exam, and if there were any other issues with the artery, it would have detected them. The 50% stenosis is not particularly alarming, especially if you're advanced in age, as it's a common finding. We are more concerned with the internal carotid artery as it can be a potential source of stroke. However, if the pain persists, you should get checked out as it could be related to other structures such as muscles or joints. It's unlikely to be related to the MRI though. Many people experience some anxiety during or after an MRI due to the confined space and loud noises, but there's nothing to worry about.",
    "1212": "Hello, the following workup should be done: 1. Physical examination 2. Blood tests 3. Chest X-ray 4. Lung function tests if necessary.

Treatment will be provided based on the underlying cause. Please provide any reports for further comment. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.",
    "1213": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. First, I would like to tell you that the Widal test, which is done for typhoid fever, may sometimes show false positive results. If I were your treating doctor, I would advise you to get some investigations done, such as a complete blood count and blood culture, liver function test, ultrasonography of the whole abdomen, and urine culture. Depending on the reports, I would prescribe medicines accordingly. It would have been helpful if you had mentioned any other symptoms besides the positive Widal test. I would advise you to visit your local doctor and get her examined along with the investigation reports as she is on methotrexate (for RA). I hope this answers your query. Take care.",

    "1216": "Thank you for bringing your question to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern, especially given your family history of heart problems. While it is possible that your chest pain is related to heartburn, it is important to rule out any potential heart issues. I recommend getting an ECG and 2D echo done to ensure that your heart is healthy. If these tests come back normal, you can likely attribute your chest pain to heartburn. In the meantime, I suggest taking pantoprazole tablets twice a day on an empty stomach. Avoid hot, spicy, and junk food, and try to keep stress and tension levels low. Sleeping with 2-3 pillows under your head can also help prevent reflux. I hope this information helps, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Wishing you good health!",

If your blood pressure cannot be controlled with lifestyle modifications, then consult Chat Doctor. But don't use medication just now.",
    "1218": "Hi, thanks for contacting Chat Doctor. I have noted that you have an excessive cough. Therefore, the first thing to investigate is respiratory causes. It could be bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or any restrictive lung disease. Additionally, it could be an allergic condition such as asthma. To investigate further, the following tests should be conducted: respiratory physical examination, auscultation, chest X-ray, and pulmonary function test. If you have acid reflux or gastritis, then irritation cough can also occur. If the cause is still not identifiable, cardiac causes should be ruled out by conducting an ECG or echo. Please avoid smoking. Keeping these in mind, consult a physician. Take care. Chat Doctor.",
    "1219": "Bad breath, or halitosis, can have a variety of causes, ranging from the food you eat to the acid secreted in your stomach. However, the main factors are often related to oral hygiene. Even if you brush regularly, deposits can accumulate on the surface of your teeth that brushing alone cannot remove. To address this issue, it is recommended to have your teeth cleaned by a dental surgeon every 6 months. These deposits can lead to gum enlargement, creating spaces where bacteria can thrive and decompose food, resulting in halitosis. In addition to regular dental cleanings, drinking plenty of water can also help alleviate bad breath.",
    "1220": "Hi! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would recommend a urine pregnancy test and a serum beta-hCG test to rule out pregnancy. If both tests are negative, I would suggest an ultrasound of the abdomen to rule out any intra-pelvic pathology, and advise you to consult a gynecologist to rule out pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Until then, you could take an anti-spasmodic medication for your cramps.",

To properly examine and diagnose the cause of your pain, I recommend consulting a gastroenterologist.\n\nThe doctor may order an ultrasound, endoscopy, and stool test, as well as take a thorough history to check the direction of the radiating pain. Depending on the diagnosis, the doctor may prescribe omeprazole, laxatives, or anti-inflammatory medication, or even recommend surgical removal of the appendix if necessary.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief and apply warm compresses to the affected areas. I also suggest maintaining a healthy diet.\n\nI hope this information addresses your concern. Best wishes for a speedy recovery.",

Based on the information you provided, it seems like you missed a birth control pill, took it the next day, and then had protected sex a few days later with some sperm getting inside. You're now wondering if you could be pregnant.\n\nThe answer is no, you are not likely to get pregnant by skipping one dose of your birth control pill. However, it's important to make sure this doesn't happen again in the future. Additionally, avoid taking two doses of the pill in the same day as it's a hormone and may cause some issues.\n\nIf you find that you're frequently forgetting to take your medication, there are other alternatives available such as an intrauterine device (IUD). With an IUD, you don't have to worry about taking pills and it's safe to use for up to five years. If you decide you want to get pregnant, the device can be easily removed.\n\nI hope this helps. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.\n\nBest regards,\nChat Doctor",
    "1225": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Recurrent chest infections and acid reflux can cause bronchitis, which can further worsen cough, breathlessness, and wheezing. It is better to consult a pulmonologist and get a pulmonary function test (PFT) done. The PFT will determine the severity of the disease, and treatment for bronchitis is based on severity. Along with antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) can be beneficial for bronchitis. At present, it is advisable to stop lifting heavy objects and start appropriate treatment for bronchitis. Once you are feeling well, you can resume your work. For acid reflux, take proton pump inhibitors and avoid hot and spicy food. Don't worry, you will be alright. I hope I have answered your query.

Your hemorrhoid removal is probably not the cause of your current symptoms. Thanks for using Chat Doctor and I wish you a speedy recovery.",
    "1229": "Hello and welcome to Ask A Doctor Service. I have read your question and here is my response. It seems like you are experiencing postural hypotension, which is a drop in blood pressure when standing up from a sitting or lying position. This can cause dizziness and is commonly seen in individuals with diabetes, especially if the diabetes is not well-controlled. Meclizine is a medication often used to treat dizziness, but it can have side effects such as weakness and an increase in blood sugar levels. It's possible that the meclizine is causing your diabetes to become more uncontrolled.\n\nIt's important to discuss this with your doctor and have your blood pressure checked while lying, sitting, and standing to determine if you have autonomic dysfunction, which is a complication of diabetes that affects the nervous system's control of involuntary functions such as blood pressure and heart rate. Your doctor can examine you for postural hypotension and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. Additionally, it may be helpful to work with a diabetes educator or nutritionist to develop a comprehensive plan for managing your diabetes, including medication, diet, and exercise.",
    "1230": "Thank you for your inquiry. After reviewing your symptoms, it is possible that the white patch on your gums could be caused by frictional keratitis or irrational fibrous or inflammatory hyperplasia. This may be due to irritation from sharp edges on your teeth or chronic biting in that area. There is no need to panic as this is a benign lesion. I recommend consulting an oral physician for further examination and treatment. If there are any sharp edges on your teeth, enameloplasty may be recommended to prevent further complications such as ulcerations. If there is a growth present at the line of occlusion, surgical removal may be necessary. I hope this information helps, and please take care.",

As you had a knee replacement, it's important to understand that there will be changes in your gait mechanism. Before the replacement, your gait mechanism was different, and after the replacement, there will be adjustments. This can lead to nerve impingement in the lumbar spine, which requires a thorough clinical examination. As a result, you may experience pain, numbness, and tiling in your legs. However, physical therapy can help correct these symptoms. In my clinical practice, I have seen many cases with similar complaints, and patients often respond well to physical therapy.

However, the question is how long this grief should persist - for days, months, or longer? The man you are speaking about is experiencing severe grief because he does not have anyone else to give him the same affection he experienced earlier. It's important to note that every person goes through bereavement, and almost everyone accepts it as part of life with the support of other people. Additionally, the bereaved person slowly tries to ignore negative thoughts as they begin to engage in work and other activities again. In this case, it seems that your man does not have any other intimate relationships and may be idle, which can exacerbate the problem. You can be there for him, show him love and affection, and slowly he should start opening up to you and accepting your presence. Time is a great healer, and with patience and understanding, you can help him through this difficult time. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.",

Based on your symptoms, it is possible that you may be experiencing orthostatic hypotension or a metabolic disorder such as thyroid dysfunction. The fact that your symptoms only occur during certain physical activities or positions suggests that it may not be a serious medical condition. However, it is still important to consult with a general practitioner for a thorough examination. They may recommend tests such as a resting ECG, chest x-ray, and blood tests to check for various levels such as thyroid hormone, cortisol, and fasting glucose. Additionally, a head-up tilt test may be necessary to properly diagnose orthostatic hypotension.

Polycythemia Vera is a myeloproliferative blood disorder in which the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells, leading to an increased risk of thrombotic complications. To prevent this, it is important to keep the hematocrit (red blood cell percentage) below 45 for men. One form of treatment is bloodletting (also known as venesection or phlebotomy), which can be combined with other therapies like hydroxyurea. The removal of blood from the body reduces blood volume and brings down hematocrit levels. Hydroxyurea is a medication that can help control the production of red blood cells.

    "1281": "Hi, welcome to ChatDoctor. I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. Elevated potassium levels is a matter of concern and immediate medical attention needs to be sought. However, there are certain things one can try at home to naturally lower the potassium levels. Increase the intake of calcium-rich foods like milk, dairy products, yogurt, and cheese. Include them regularly in your diet can help control the potassium levels in the blood. Eat a clove of garlic in the morning and one in the evening, with a glass of milk. It interferes with potassium absorption and ultimately helps to lower potassium level in blood. Water helps in flushing out toxins and excess of potassium. However, for individuals suffering from kidney disorders, it is crucial to consult your physician before increasing the uptake of water. Excessive consumption of water in individuals with kidney disorders can result in strain on the kidney which can complicate matters. As our body works as a unit, all factors are related to each other, and the main cause for all problems is our weakened immune system. To strengthen immunity and achieve overall health, we need to take a proper balanced diet and avoid the intake of fried fast foods, tea, coffee, and colas. Stop smoking and alcohol consumption as they are harmful for your health and interfere with the normal functioning of your body organs. It is advisable to get your blood potassium levels checked regularly to keep a track of any abnormalities. If symptoms persist or worsen, please seek medical attention immediately.",

To prevent further irritation, avoid fried foods, spicy foods, and junk food. Quit smoking if you smoke. If there are septic foci in your tonsils, consider getting them removed surgically. As you experience throat irritation with fever, the possibility of an allergy is lower. I recommend doing salt water gargles or Listerine gargles daily to keep your throat clean and healthy. OK, bye.",

It is also important for patients to get adequate rest, eat a balanced diet, avoid alcohol and other liver toxins, and regularly monitor their liver function through blood tests and imaging studies. In some cases, hospitalization may be necessary for severe symptoms or complications. Self-care measures for hepatitis B include practicing good hygiene, avoiding sharing personal care items like razors or toothbrushes, and getting vaccinated to prevent future infections. It is also important to avoid activities that may spread the virus to others, such as unprotected sexual contact or sharing needles. Finally, patients with hepatitis B should regularly monitor their liver health and see a healthcare provider for check-ups and treatment recommendations.",

Diets high in salt or sodium can increase the excretion of calcium into the urine and thus increase the risk of calcium-containing kidney stones. Reducing salt intake is preferred to reducing calcium intake. Foods rich in animal proteins, such as meat, eggs, and fish, contain purines and can increase the risk of uric acid stones and calcium stones. Getting calcium from food can help prevent kidney stone formation and help maintain bone density. Avoiding foods rich in oxalate, such as spinach and rhubarb, may help prevent calcium oxalate stones.

Dry socket, also known as alveolar osteitis, is an infection of the healing socket and can be suspected if there is pain or delayed healing. If you are experiencing no pain and it has been 16 hours since the bleeding stopped, it is less likely that you have developed dry socket.

Total mastectomy, with or without reconstruction, may be necessary in some cases.

    "1353": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should immediately consult a cardiologist. A sudden increase in heart rate, even at rest, is commonly seen in cardiac rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias), which can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early and treated promptly. Therefore, it is better to consult a cardiologist and have the following tests done: 1. ECG, 2. 2D echo, and 3. Holder monitoring (24-hour continuous monitoring of ECG). You may need anti-arrhythmic medication. I hope I have answered your question. Wishing you good health. Thank you.",

    "1360": "Hello, thank you for your question. I am sorry to hear about your wife's previous pregnancies and the complications she has faced. Given her medical history, it is understandable that your infertility specialist has recommended IVF as a means of achieving a successful pregnancy. With modern medical advances, the success rates of IVF have been increasing and are generally encouraging. As for improving sperm count, there are various factors that can affect sperm production, including diet and lifestyle choices. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables can be beneficial for overall health and potentially improve sperm quality. Specifically, fruits such as bananas, pomegranates, and blueberries are often touted for their potential benefits in supporting reproductive health. However, it is important to consult with your doctor or a nutritionist for personalized advice on dietary and lifestyle changes that may be beneficial for you and your wife during the IVF process.",
    "1361": "Hi, thanks for asking. Based on your situation, my analysis is as follows: 1. Although your creatinine levels are high, they are still within manageable limits. 2. However, given that your kidney is not functioning properly, dialysis may be necessary in the future. 3.

Your difficulty sleeping, scary dreams, and waking up with a racing heart and sweating could be indicators of anxiety. The pain in your neck and shoulders could be related to muscle tension, which is common with anxiety. Your feelings of sadness, irritability, and preference for solitude could be signs of depression.\n\nIt's important to note that disappointment or unforeseen life events could also be contributing to your symptoms. I encourage you to try talking to friends, engaging in outdoor activities, and exploring creative outlets as these can often provide relief.\n\nIf you find that your symptoms persist or worsen, it may be helpful to consult with a psychologist who can provide a more thorough evaluation and discuss potential psychotherapy techniques that could be beneficial for you.",

    "1365": "Hi Raghu,\n\nThank you for reaching out. I understand your concern regarding hair loss. First, it's important to consider if there's a family history of hair loss, as genetic factors can play a role. If there is a history of male baldness in your family, medical treatment may not be as effective.\n\nOther potential causes of hair loss include hormonal imbalances (such as thyroid issues), lifestyle or environmental changes, stress, recent illness, or chemical treatments. It's also important to note if you're experiencing hair loss in other parts of your body.\n\nFor now, you can continue using the Mintop Forte solution as advised, along with daily hair supplements like Collinear. Keep in mind that improvement may not be visible within a week, and consistent use for at least 2-3 months may be necessary.\n\nSince you've been trying various treatments for a long time without much success, I recommend consulting a dermatologist. They can assess the type of hair loss you're experiencing and provide tailored treatment recommendations based on their findings. They may also suggest routine blood tests if needed.\n\nIf medical methods don't yield the desired results, your consulting doctor may consider alternative surgical procedures such as PRP or hair transplants, depending on your specific case.\n\nIn addition to professional treatment, maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet, reducing stress, avoiding smoking, and getting adequate rest can also support healthy hair growth.\n\nI hope this information helps guide you on your journey to addressing hair loss. Best of luck!",

How often does your child's sleep get disturbed due to these symptoms?\n3. Does your child feel breathless when engaging in physical activities, such as running or playing with other children?\n4.

    "1369": "Hi! Welcome to ChatDoctor.com. There are several possible causes for a high white blood cell count/leukocytosis: Physical stress (e.g., from seizures, anesthesia or overexertion) and emotional stress can also elevate white blood cell counts. Medications commonly associated with leukocytosis include corticosteroids, lithium, and beta agonists. Increased eosinophil or basophil counts, resulting from a variety of infections, allergic reactions, and other causes, can lead to leukocytosis in some patients. Further investigation should include a differential leukocyte count (which tells which type of white blood cell is high), platelet count, hemoglobin level, bone marrow aspiration, and biopsy to rule out leukemia.

It is recommended to get blood tests to check for specific antibodies in the blood serum against common foods such as milk, wheat, egg, potato, China rice, nuts, and other daily food items. It is likely that one or three food products will show up in the test, and by eliminating them from the diet, the patient should feel better within 3 weeks and completely recovered in 3 months. Start with eliminating wheat and dairy products from the diet and see how it affects the symptoms. It is important to work with a qualified healthcare provider to manage and treat the patient's condition effectively.",
    "1371": "Hello, thank you for writing to us with your health concern. You are currently experiencing amenorrhea due to the contraceptive injection, which often leads to residual amenorrhea. It may take up to 3-6 months for your normal cycles to resume. To start the pill, it is recommended to begin taking it on day 2 or day 3 of your period. However, since you are currently amenorrheic, it is best to induce your period first. This can be done by taking progesterone preparations (such as Meprate, Deviry, Norlutein N, Primolut N, etc.) twice or thrice a day for 5 days. After stopping the medication, you should experience withdrawal bleeding within 5-7 days, which will serve as day 1 of your new cycle. You can then start taking the oral contraceptive pill on day 2 or day 3 of this new cycle. If you do not experience withdrawal bleeding, please consult with a healthcare professional before starting the pill.",

It sounds like you are doing your best to manage your symptoms with the treatment prescribed by your psychiatrist. The hallucinations and jaw pain you are experiencing could be related to your bipolar/borderline personality disorder/major depressive disorder or could be side effects of the medication you are on. It would be best to discuss this with your psychiatrist or a family physician who can refer you to a specialist if needed.\n\nIt's understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed and struggling with suicidal thoughts. It's great that you have a supportive family and employer who understand your situation. Your faith in God is also a strength that you can rely on during difficult times.\n\nECT (electroconvulsive therapy) can be an effective treatment for severe depression, but it's understandable that you are hesitant to undergo more sessions due to the memory side effects. It's important to have an open and honest discussion with your psychiatrist about the risks and benefits of ECT, as well as alternative treatment options.\n\nPlease know that there is hope and help available for you.

You have given information about your cholesterol levels, which have decreased in the past 2 years and are now at 165 mg/DL. This value refers to your total cholesterol level. I assume that all other parameters are within normal limits. Cholesterol testing actually requires a complete lipid profile which includes total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels. Out of these, HDL should be high as it is a good form of cholesterol, and all others should be low. Even if your total cholesterol is normal, you should follow a healthy diet and lifestyle, including avoiding tobacco use and alcohol (if you consume it), regular exercise, and taking care of your diet.

    "1379": "Dear user, I have carefully evaluated your query. Any surgery, whether minor or major, carries some degree of risk for any person. In your case, as the surgery is major and you have multiple comorbidities, your risk is higher than that of the average person undergoing the same surgery. The outcome in terms of success and potential complications will be evaluated by a team of expert anesthesiologists and surgeons. Ultimately, the decision to proceed with surgery will depend on a careful assessment of the severity of your symptoms and the potential risks involved in and after the procedure. My personal recommendation for you is to carefully consider whether the symptoms you are experiencing are severe enough to warrant the risks associated with surgery. If your symptoms are causing significant distress and impacting your daily life, it may be worth taking the risk and proceeding with the surgery. However, if your symptoms are manageable and not causing significant problems, it may be best to avoid the risks associated with surgery. I hope this information is helpful to you. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can do to assist you. Wishing you the best of health in the future. Regards, take care.",
    "1380": "Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion, the lesions seen on the chest x-ray are currently due to healed fibrotic scars. There is no need to worry about this as it will persist for life. However, you need to prove that these lesions are not active and are only healed scars. Therefore, you should get a CT THORAX and bronchoscopy with BAD (Bronchi Alveolar Lavage) analysis for AFB. If both of these are negative, there is no need to worry about active TB. So, consult a pulmonologist and discuss all of these. You definitely need a certificate for future employment issues.",
    "1381": "There are quite a few other therapies for pain management that you could explore. The operation is intriguing because the shoulder and back are not connected, and if the pain is in the lower part of the shoulder, it could be related to neck disk disease, which often shows up on X-rays.\n\nAs for pain management, there are multiple levels of treatment. The first level is addressing the underlying issue, which in this case could be surgery. The second level is managing the pain caused by the problem, which could involve nerve pills or muscle relaxants. Amitriptyline is a medication that works at both the nerve and spine levels to block pain signals.\n\nThe third level of treatment involves managing the context in which the pain is experienced. This is where mindfulness, yoga, and physical therapy come in. While there is some debate about the effectiveness of these treatments, they can be helpful in reducing pain perception and increasing one's ability to manage pain. Exercise and physical therapy, in particular, can be effective in reducing pain over time, even if they are initially painful. It's important to note that pain may increase for the first two months of physical therapy before stabilizing.",

It can be caused by any bacteria, and it's possible that it could have come from fecal matter or your pet. Applying hot fomentation would be helpful for this condition. If there is no improvement, then antibiotics will be required. I usually suggest a combination of antibiotics like ofloxacin and ornidazole for such cases. Chlamydia is most unlikely since you have never had intercourse. Additionally, the Z-pack you took would have covered chlamydia as well. To prevent future infections, you can use an intimate wash daily to normalize vaginal bacterial flora and pH. Let me know if you have any further questions or if anything is unclear. Thanks.",

However, it is better to first rule out heart diseases because left-sided chest and shoulder pain are commonly seen in heart diseases. Therefore, I recommend getting an ECG and 2D echo done first. If both tests are normal, then there is no need to worry about heart diseases. Naproxen is only a painkiller, so it is better to take a combination of a painkiller and muscle relaxant.

The first 8 days and the last 8 days of your cycle are considered a safe period if you have regular periods. There is no need to worry.

Applying a painkiller gel containing ibuprofen can also help with the pain. To further investigate any potential tendon tears (rotator cuff), an ultrasonography or MRI scan would be valuable.

It is important to practice good hygiene, such as washing hands frequently and covering any open wounds, to prevent the spread of MRSA. It is also advisable to avoid sharing personal items like towels or clothing with an infected person. If you suspect that you may have been exposed to MRSA, please consult with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment options. Best wishes for your health.",
    "1427": "Hi there, thank you for reaching out to me for assistance. I can understand your concern regarding your wife's persistent fever and shivering at night. Based on your description, it is advisable to seek medical attention from a general physician. They can perform a complete urine culture examination, CBC (Complete Blood Count), ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate), chest x-ray, and sputum examination to determine the underlying cause of the fever. The possible causes for this fever could be a urinary tract infection, tuberculosis, or a viral infection. Until then, it is recommended to continue taking the prescribed antibiotic along with Ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory medication. Please keep me updated on your wife's condition, and I hope she recovers soon.",
    "1429": "Dear user, Thank you for writing to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern about your inability to maintain an erection, which is causing trouble in your sexual relationship. If you are able to achieve and maintain an erection during sleep, in the early morning, or through masturbation, then there is likely no underlying issue and the problem may be related to performance anxiety. However, if you are unable to do so, I recommend consulting a urologist or psychiatrist to rule out any other potential causes and to discuss effective treatment options. I wish you the best of health.",
    "1430": "Hi! Thanks for reaching out to us, and I must say that this is a common occurrence. You are right in this instance! This does not require a skin stamp to confirm it as a subcutaneous collection of blood, lymph, or even pus. Therefore, a fine needle aspiration or needle biopsy is urgent in this case to confirm the diagnosis and potentially provide a cure. Therefore, the opinion of a neurosurgeon or at least a surgeon is necessary in your daughter's case. Also, please provide us with feedback; best regards.",
    "1431": "Hello, Thank you for your question. Your ultrasound scan has shown a gallbladder stone with multiple polyps and a non-obstructing stone in the left kidney. In this situation, the stone in the gallbladder and polyps in the gallbladder should be dealt with first by performing laparoscopic surgery (Cholecystectomy). The small stone in the left kidney is expected to pass spontaneously. I recommend consulting a doctor for further evaluation and management of your symptoms. Additionally, I suggest addressing your concerns about leg edema and difficulty sleeping with your healthcare provider as these may be related to other underlying conditions.",

I understand that your brother has been suffering from fever for the past three months and has been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis. While he has completed a three-month course of Rifamycin, the fever still persists and comes on in the evenings. If I am your doctor, I would advise that the continuation of treatment is crucial in pulmonary tuberculosis, rather than focusing on when the fever will resolve. The fever will continue until the bacillary load in the body reduces, so it is essential to maintain regularity and continuity of treatment. I am here to answer any further concerns you may have, and I wish you the best of health. Thank you for trusting Chat Doctor.",

There is no need to worry about the pulsating sensations of the artery and seek treatment for your anxiety. I hope this helps you.",
    "1434": "Hello Beverly, Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. Based on your symptoms, there are a few possibilities that could be causing your discomfort. One possibility is a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), which is more common in females. To rule out this condition, a urine examination is typically recommended. Another possibility is kidney stones, which can also cause pain in the lower back and sides. Increasing your fluid intake can be helpful in both cases, as it can help flush out any infection or stones. I would advise you to drink as much water as you can comfortably tolerate. I hope this information helps. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please consider seeking medical attention.",
    "1435": "Hi, I have gone through your question and I can understand your concern. The lump you have noticed on the right side of your cervicle near the hollow of your neck could be a bony lump or an enlarged lymph node. To investigate further, you should go for an X-ray. If there is no bony lump, then you should consider undergoing a fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) or a biopsy of the lump. The possible causes for the enlarged lymph node could be reactive hyperplasia, tuberculosis, lymphoma, or metastatic carcinoma. FNAC will provide an exact diagnosis, and then you can proceed with appropriate treatment. If you have any doubts, please feel free to ask. Thanks for using Chat Doctor, and I wish you the best of health.",
    "1436": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Dental pain often radiates to surrounding structures like the head, ear, neck, and temple area. Toothache indicates bacterial decay or infection in the tooth that involves the exposed tooth nerve tissues. Such an infected tooth needs to be treated by a root canal procedure, so please consider getting the treatment done by consulting a dentist. You may need an OPG radiographic examination done for your teeth to confirm the spread of infection or to rule out the exact cause of the pain and swelling in the temple area. I would suggest you start with antibiotic Augmentin 625 mg along with analgesics like diclofenac two times daily for 3 to 5 days. I hope this helps, take care.",

It's good that coconut oil provided some relief. When patients visit me with such cases, I advise them to take fexofenadine 180mg one tablet and deflazacort 12mg together, and they will get relief. It's possible that you may need a second dose. Additionally, applying clotrimazole lotion locally will provide immediate relief. However, be cautious when using dye in the future. Since this is a prescription medication, please consult a doctor for further assistance. Good luck.",

    "1443": "Hello there, Your clinical signs and MRI results suggest poster Central disc protrusion, which can be managed conservatively through neck extension exercises, Inferential therapy, and moist heat therapy. A few sessions of short wave diathermy can also be helpful, but not continuously. The best person to help you manage your pain would be a physiotherapist who is certified and experienced in MC. Kenzie manual therapy techniques for the spine. Traction therapy can also be helpful in reducing the radiation of pain. A combination of physiotherapy as mentioned above and some NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can be effective. If this does not provide any relief, you may consider OZONE THERAPY, and in the worst case scenario (such as herniation stage), surgery may be the only solution. I hope this information helps you find relief from your pain and wish you a pain-free and enjoyable life soon.",
    "1444": "Hello. That's a very good question. The answer depends on the size of the lump, its exact location, and whether you are married or unmarried (and whether you have children). Any surgeon with good experience will be well-versed in these criteria, so please don't worry. A general surgeon can perform the procedure nicely. Please discuss all the points I have noted with your surgeon. The most important criterion is whether the lump is cancerous or not, and an excision biopsy is the best way to determine that, so please proceed with that. The surgeon will certainly be concerned about maintaining aesthetics.",
    "1445": "Dear Theresa,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing your question regarding switching medications. I understand that you are currently taking Geodon for Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar 1, and you are curious about switching to Nardil without the typical two-week washout period.\n\nI appreciate your proactive approach to researching drug interactions, and I am glad to hear that you have checked each of your other medications and found them to be safe. However, psychiatric medications are prescribed based on a patient's specific condition, and the consequences of depressive and bipolar disorders can be severe. Therefore, psychiatrists take many factors into consideration when making treatment decisions, including the use of differential diagnosis to confirm a diagnosis.\n\nDiscussing the effects of medications on a patient is complex and requires a thorough understanding of their unique circumstances. Geodon (ziprasidone) is an antipsychotic medication that works by altering the effects of chemicals in the brain. It is commonly used to treat schizophrenia and the manic symptoms of bipolar disorder.\n\nI strongly recommend that you discuss your research findings with your psychiatrist in detail. They will be able to take into account your individual situation and make an informed decision about your treatment plan. If you would like more assistance in this matter, please feel free to use the provided URL for further clarification.\n\nIn conclusion, please work closely with your psychiatrist to ensure the best possible care for your condition.

    "1454": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. I am not aware of any specific bump that is consistently associated with people born between 1980 and 2000. It would be helpful if you could provide more details about the location, size, and growth rate of the bump on your head. Bumps on the back of the head that feel like bone may not necessarily be bony growths or originate from within the skull. Many such bumps are firm enough to give a bony feeling and are usually benign growths, which can be referred to as cysts. There are several types of cysts that can occur on the scalp, including epidermal cysts, sebaceous cysts, and Desmond cysts. I recommend consulting a doctor to assess the likelihood of the bump being a cyst or another type of growth. A CT scan of the brain may be necessary to characterize the bump and determine if any immediate treatment is required. Please try not to worry.",

I recommend that she have an MRI of her spine to check for any disc bulges or spinal canal stenosis. Additionally, checking her vitamin B12 and vitamin D3 levels may be helpful. Medications such as methylcobalamine and analgesics can help reduce pain. She may also benefit from yoga exercises and spine extension exercises, which can be guided by a physiotherapist. They may also recommend treatments like TENS or ultrasound. If these measures do not provide relief, epidural injections may be an option to consider.

I would like to know if your fingers get discolored during these episodes (a slight change in the color, bluish or pale color) and if these episodes are also triggered by the cold weather. Your symptoms may be related to Raynaud's phenomenon or to low blood flow to the small vessels of the hands and feet, caused by systemic low blood pressure. I recommend consulting with your attending physician to consider the possibility of making some changes to your antihypertensive therapy to avoid such low values of blood pressure (such as decreasing the dosage or stopping one of your medications). Beta blockers can trigger these phenomena and exacerbate your symptoms, while calcium channel blockers are very helpful in avoiding the occurrence of such phenomena. I hope this is helpful!

    "1459": "Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. It seems like you may have a persistent sinus infection. I recommend getting a para nasal sinus x-ray to rule out sinusitis and a nasal examination by rhinoscopy to rule out nasal polyps. For congestive symptoms, you can take antihistamines. Steam inhalation with eucalyptus added in water can also help. If the cause is not clear, an MRI or CT scan of the sinuses may be needed for a detailed investigation. If you are immunocompromised, aspergillosis or mucormycosis may need to be ruled out, and this investigation can be helpful for that. If needed, endoscopic surgery can be considered.

    "1461": "Hello, thank you for reaching out to me. I have carefully reviewed the information you provided. Please understand that cirrhosis is not solely caused by the failure to treat jaundice effectively. Jaundice is a symptom of an underlying liver problem that requires evaluation and treatment. As the disease progresses from the hepatitis stage to cirrhosis, the prognosis becomes less favorable. Given your description of cirrhosis and pneumonia, it appears that multiple organs are affected, which may indicate a poorer prognosis. However, the prognosis ultimately depends on the results of various investigations. Please provide us with more information on the investigations so that we can offer more specific advice. Currently, liver transplantation is a viable option if the only issue is with the liver and other systems are functioning normally.",

When patients with similar symptoms visit me, I usually prescribe montelukast and albuterol tablets once or twice a day, depending on the severity of their symptoms. Usually, patients respond very well to this treatment and do not require any additional medication. Since you have a history of asthma, avoidance is also important. Mites, dust, pollen, hay, fodder, sudden changes in temperature, pests, and smoke are certain triggering factors. Hot coffee and steam can also provide some relief for asthma patients. Avoid steroids as much as possible.",

The following antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of the Odessa pill: Rifampicine, Amoxicillin, ampicillin, griseofulvin, metronidazole, tetracycline, penicillin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim), minocycline, and nitrofurantoin. These antibiotics increase the metabolism of the pill and decrease the circulating hormone levels. The effect will only be for that particular month.

After undergoing an ultrasound examination, the doctor observed a gravid uterus with a single gestational sac inside, but no fetal pole was seen in the sac. The gestational sac measures 1.1cm, corresponding to an average gestational age of 4 weeks. Your last menstrual period was on September 6th, 2012, and you have been treated with Clomid, 5 Menogon injections, 1 Chorimon injection, and Cyclogest pessaries.\n\nRegarding your current situation, the PCOD in the left ovary is not relevant now that you are pregnant. However, you may need earlier screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (DM). As for the pregnancy, there are three possible scenarios: you may be looking too early, there could be a potential miscarriage, or there may be a delay in the apparent growth of the pregnancy compared to when you think you conceived.\n\nI recommend scheduling another ultrasound in one week to get a clearer picture of your pregnancy.

Based on the symptoms you have described, it seems more likely that your boyfriend is suffering from a urinary stone. To confirm this, I recommend that he undergoes an ultrasound examination of the abdomen, which will provide more information on the location and any inflammatory changes present.\n\nIn addition to the ultrasound, I suggest that your boyfriend takes opioid analgesics to help manage the pain associated with the stone.

Warm up and stretch your hand and finger muscles before engaging in activities that require gripping objects like a hammer or knife. 2. Consult with a qualified trainer or hand specialist to discuss proper hand and finger positioning during activities. 3. Avoid repeatedly using your hands and fingers in a way that causes cramping.

    "1493": "Dear patient, Thank you for reaching out to me regarding your travel plans during your 30th week of pregnancy. I understand your concern and would be happy to provide you with some advice. If you are in a developing or undeveloped country, the road conditions may not be ideal for a long car ride. Therefore, I would not recommend traveling by car at this stage. However, if you are in a developed country with good road conditions, car travel is permissible. I would advise you to consider traveling two weeks earlier than your planned date as pregnancy is most stable between 12 to 28 weeks. After 28 weeks, there is a risk of preterm delivery due to travel-related stress and strain on the uterus. Additionally, traveling for 12 hours at a stretch can be uncomfortable and stressful for you at this stage of pregnancy. If you do decide to travel by car, I recommend taking breaks after every 2 hours of travel for 15-30 minutes. This will allow you to stretch your legs, ease your back, and use the restroom before resuming the journey. While this may add an hour or more to your travel time, it is better for you and your baby's safety. Alternatively, air travel is the best option for traveling during pregnancy, although airlines may have restrictions for pregnant women after 28 weeks of pregnancy and may require an obstetrician's certificate. I hope this advice helps you make an informed decision regarding your travel plans. Wishing you a safe and healthy pregnancy!",

Try not to worry, as he will be alright. However, prioritizing a chest x-ray is crucial. I hope I have addressed your concern. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.",

The normal range you mentioned is established for your environmental conditions and climates. Neutrophils tend to decrease slightly in older age. Given your current condition where you do not have any symptoms or complaints, I recommend a follow-up with a repeat test.\n\nRegarding eosinophils, which are increased in allergic conditions such as allergic skin disease, asthma, and parasites, they are commonly borderline increased in allergic cold and cough. I suggest you have your blood smear interpretation done which will guide regarding maturation or any other abnormality. Look for any allergies you may have and get your peripheral blood smear examined to clear any doubts.\n\nThanks for contacting, and good luck!",
    "1506": "Hello, The MRI findings suggest mild cerebral cortical atrophy. This is generally an age-related finding, but in your son's case, it is occurring earlier as he is only 17 years old. The cause of mild cerebral cortical atrophy should be investigated. It may be a result of past infection, generalized ischemia, or other factors. You should consult a neurologist for further evaluation and management. The mucosal polyp in the left maxillary sinus may be due to chronic sinusitis. Long-standing infection can lead to polyp formation. Surgical removal of the polyp can be considered after evaluation by an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist). Take care and chat with a doctor for further assistance.",

His symptoms, including coughing, fever with chills, loss of appetite, and fatigue, suggest a lung infection. Therefore, it is recommended to get a chest x-ray done. He may require antibiotics, antihistamines, and anti-inflammatory medications. Early identification of the infection and prompt antibiotic treatment can lead to a good prognosis. So, please get a chest x-ray done and start appropriate antibiotic treatment. I hope I have addressed your concern. Wishing you good health. Thank you.",
    "1508": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. After going through your query, I believe you are experiencing chronic back pain. The treatment for back pain typically involves exercises and analgesics (such as diclofenac). Sometimes, vitamin D deficiency can be the cause, so it may be worth getting your vitamin D levels checked. If they are low, vitamin D supplementation can be taken weekly with milk. Avoid prolonged standing and make sure to sit with a straight posture. Include milk and milk products, fruits, and green leafy vegetables in your daily diet.\n\nRegarding the electoral packets you mentioned, taking them daily has no direct effect on treating backache, but they also don't have any side effects. However, it's still advisable to discuss this with your treating doctor. To further investigate your condition, an MRI of the affected area is recommended. I hope this answers your question. Feel free to ask any follow-up questions.",

I recommend that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a cardiologist to further evaluate your symptoms.\n\nDuring your appointment, your doctor may perform an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) to check for any abnormalities in your heart rhythm. They may also recommend additional testing such as a Holter monitor or event monitor to further evaluate your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, try to avoid any activities that trigger your symptoms and practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation to help manage any stress or anxiety you may be experiencing.",
    "1510": "Blood ammonia primarily comes from the bacterial breakdown of absorbed dietary protein in the intestine. Intestinal ammonia enters the bloodstream and travels to the liver, where it is converted into urea. Urea is then excreted from the body through the urine. High blood ammonia levels can be caused by various chronic liver diseases, acute liver failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (any condition that increases protein in the gut). Additionally, certain medications like valproic acid and excessive protein intake can also lead to high blood ammonia levels. It is possible that bacteria in the gut could contribute to high blood ammonia levels, and antibiotics like Cipro may be helpful in reducing ammonia levels by altering the gut bacterial population. However, further evaluation and testing are usually necessary to determine the underlying cause of high blood ammonia levels.",

Your HbA1c level is very high, indicating poor control of your diabetes. Therefore, the first step is to control your diabetes. You can achieve this by taking insulin or oral anti-diabetic medication. Once your blood sugar levels are under control, your ulcer will heal faster.

For the pain, you can take ibuprofen (if you are not allergic to any medications) and you may need a prescription for antibiotics. Please consult an endodontist to receive the appropriate treatment. Use warm salt water to gargle and avoid applying hot compresses to the area. I hope this information is helpful. Best regards.",

Pregnancy is only possible during the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, which is when a mature egg is released and needs to be fertilized by sperm for conception.

    "1524": "Hello! Welcome to Chat Doctor! These MRI results indicate chronic degeneration of the vertebral column, which is related to poor posture and osteoporosis. Surgery is not necessary. I would only recommend wearing a cervical collar for short periods of time if you experience neck pain. It is important to do physiotherapy and physical exercise to strengthen your back muscles. Correcting your posture is also important. I would advise consulting with a rheumatologist and taking supplements for osteoporosis to stop the progression of this condition.

    "1531": "Hi, There are several possibilities, but the more likely one based on your symptoms of feeling hot and faint (with vision dimming) after standing for a while is that your blood pressure dropped. Sitting down was the right thing to do to prevent what we call a vasovagal reaction.

I recommend that you consult with your pediatrician and have a rapid streptococcal antigen test done. If the test is positive, then your child will require antibiotics. However, if the test is negative, it may be a viral illness and antibiotics are not necessary. For cold symptoms, you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nasal congestion, saline nasal decongestants can be used. Paracetamol can be given in a dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6 hours, but only if the fever is above 100F.

However, in old age, reactivation of dormant TB bacteria can occur. Therefore, we need to rule out active tuberculosis in him. Please get a sputum examination done for AFB (acid-fast bacilli - bacteria that cause tuberculosis). If this is negative, then there is no need to worry about active tuberculosis. Post-infectious bronchitis is also a possibility, and coughing is a common symptom of it. Therefore, please get a PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) done, and if it shows an obstructive defect, he may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

This schedule involves receiving five shots of the anti-rabies vaccine on specific days: day 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28.

The smaller lump, which is now reddish in color, is likely a result of an infected tooth that has caused an abscess. The larger lump on the back side of your gums, which is painful to touch and sometimes discharges puss when pressed, is likely a result of the infection spreading to the tissue spaces in your mouth.\n\nIt's possible that the infection could be related to a tooth that was filled about a year ago and is now causing problems. I recommend that you consult an oral surgeon for a proper diagnosis and to rule out any other potential causes, such as sinusitis or an infection related to the middle ear.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help manage the pain. It's also important to maintain good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly. Gargling with a mouthwash like Listerine can also help to keep the area clean.\n\nIf you are not allergic, a combination of penicillin and metronidazole with an analgesic can be effective in subsiding the infection.

You may be prescribed antifungal medication such as ketoconazole for two weeks, along with antihistamines like levocetirizine. A short course of antibiotics may also be recommended.

    "1566": "Hi, thanks for your question. Based on your husband's situation, here is my advice: 1. He should not stop using Plavix without consulting his doctor. 2. A platelet count of 74,000 is not necessarily cause for concern. A count above 20,000-30,000 is generally considered safe. 3. It is important for your husband to continue taking Plavix and baby aspirin after having stents placed to reduce the risk of thrombus formation. 4. Taking vitamin B12 supplements may help improve his platelet count. I hope this information helps. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.",

Your platelet count is low at 70,000, but other than that, you have not faced any other problems. Your RNA test result is negative, but your HCV test is positive. Additionally, your stiffness test results have increased from 48 to 68 over a period of 6 months.\n\nThe low platelet count in HCV is mostly due to an enlarged spleen, which entraps the platelets and causes their destruction. It is important to get your liver function tests done regularly to monitor your liver health. As your HCV PCR test result is negative, there is no need to start treatment for the eradication of HCV at this time. However, it is important to meet with a hepatologist for regular follow-up appointments to monitor your condition closely.\n\nI hope this information helps.

    "1587": "Hello, thank you for using Chat Doctor. The iPill is a progesterone-based medication and is effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within the recommended time period of less than 72 hours following intercourse. Occasional use of the iPill has no effect on fertility. However, persistent use for years could suppress ovulation, which may take a long time to return to normal, possibly up to six months or even over one year. This could result in difficulty conceiving in the future. It is important to note that unprotected intercourse also carries the risk of sexually transmissible infections such as HIV, herpes, hepatitis B virus, and HPV which is associated with cervical cancer. It is advisable to use protective measures during sexual intercourse to avoid such risks. Best regards, Chat Doctor.",
    "1588": "Hi there, I understand your concern and will suggest the best possible treatment options. First and foremost, try not to panic. Given that all your test results are normal, there's no need to worry about getting pregnant. I assume that your partner's semen analysis is normal, your Fallopian tubes are patent, and you are ovulating regularly with no structural abnormalities in your reproductive organs.\n\nI recommend seeking the help of a gynecologist for the following steps:\n\n1. Start ovulation induction medications like Camphene citrate 50 mg once a day for 5 days, beginning on the second day of your cycle.\n2. Begin an ovulation study on the 10th day of your cycle.\n3. When the follicle reaches 18 mm in size, take an Injection of HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) 5000 IU. This will aid in egg formation within 24 to 36 hours.\n4. On the day of ovulation, you can opt for Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).\n\nContinue with lifestyle changes and other advice as previously recommended. Remember to stay positive and optimistic. I hope this information helps you, and I wish you all the best on your journey to becoming parents.",
    "1590": "Thanks for your question on HealthTap. I can understand your situation and concern. The presence of yellow mucus when coughing suggests an infectious etiology. Since you had pneumonia previously, there is a higher possibility of a recurrence of pneumonia. Therefore, it is better to consult a pulmonologist and get a clinical examination of your respiratory system, a chest X-ray, and a sputum culture and sensitivity test done. A repeat chest X-ray is necessary for diagnosing a recurrence of pneumonia. The sputum culture will identify the causative organism, and the sensitivity report will guide us on effective antibiotic treatment. This will prevent the inappropriate use of antibiotics. By following these steps, we can address your concern. I hope this answers your question. Wishing you good health. Thanks.",

    "1599": "Hi, thanks for consulting with me. I'm sorry to hear about your baby's discomfort. Coughing up mucus plugs can be a sign of respiratory distress in infants, and it's important to seek medical attention promptly if it happens again. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help prevent this from happening again and to provide some relief if it does occur.\n\nFirst, make sure your baby is hydrated by offering small amounts of breastmilk or formula frequently. You can also use a humidifier to keep the air in your home moist, which can help loosen mucus and make it easier for your baby to breathe.\n\nIf your baby does start coughing up mucus again, try to keep them calm and upright. You can also use a bulb syringe to gently suction out any mucus from their nose or mouth. If their symptoms worsen or they become lethargic, however, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nAs for home remedies, you can try giving your baby a warm bath to help loosen mucus and make them more comfortable. You can also offer them small amounts of honey (if they're over one year old) or lemon juice in water to help soothe their throat. However, it's important to talk to your pediatrician before trying any new remedies or medications.",

The shooting pain that runs down the leg could be due to nerve entrapment. With the help of an MRI scan, we can better understand the pathology of the disc in the lumbar spine. Once we understand the pathology, you may be referred to a physical therapist for further management. Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy can help stop the pain and shooting sensations. Later stages of exercise will focus on strengthening the muscles of the back, core, pelvic floor, and lower limbs as a whole. You should see improvement in about 3-4 weeks. In my clinical experience, most cases with similar symptoms respond well to a combination of treatments. Best regards, Dr. Jay.",

    "1606": "Hi, This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and eagerly. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatulence, this discomfort will persist. Next time, check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in the air too. Usually, I don't recommend any medicines for this as they only provide temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress are: 1. Do not put the baby in a lying position after feeding until the baby burps out the swallowed air. 2. If the baby is still crying, put them in a prone position and gently pat their back so that they pass gas and get relief. Babies of this age may have bowel movements once in 10 days or 10 times a day. As long as the baby is active and feeding well, don't worry. I hope I have answered your question.

    "1610": "Hi, thanks for your question. Based on your symptoms and explanation, the blister-like appearance on the gum line of the tooth with a cap is most likely due to secondary decay in the tooth caused by the seepage of fluids and debris between the cap and tooth. It could also be due to a deep infection in the gums, leading to the accumulation of bacteria deep into the gum pocket, resulting in pus formation and the formation of a gum abscess. The black discoloration around the tooth, along with sensitivity to hot and cold, is also an indication of an infection in the tooth and not just a tattoo. Therefore, my recommendation is to consult an endodontist for a thorough evaluation and investigation, such as an x-ray of both capped teeth, followed by appropriate treatment. In the case of tooth decay, removal of the cap followed by root canal treatment may help. In the case of gum infection, deep scaling and curettage may be beneficial. I hope this answers your question. Regards.",

The maxilla also has many lymph nodes, so there is also a possibility of lymph node enlargement.

    "1616": "Hello Asia, Bleeding gums can be a sign that you are at risk for, or already have, gum disease. However, persistent gum bleeding may be due to serious medical conditions such as leukemia and bleeding and platelet disorders. Bleeding gums are usually caused by inadequate plaque removal from the teeth at the gum line, leading to a condition called gingivitis or inflamed gums. If plaque is not removed through regular brushing and dental appointments, it will harden into what is known as tartar, which can lead to increased bleeding and more advanced forms of gum and jawbone disease known as periodontitis. Other possible causes include Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, scurvy, leukemia, and vitamin K deficiency. To address this issue, I recommend improving your nighttime hygiene routine and avoiding eating too close to bedtime. Make sure to brush your teeth twice a day, and consider consulting a dentist and/or hematologist for further evaluation and treatment. I hope this information helps, and I wish you the best.",

When you feel yourself getting angry, try turning away from the situation and avoiding verbal responses.

With practice, you'll find that silence can lead to inner peace and satisfaction, and can help you avoid uncomfortable situations. Best of luck to you.",

    "1638": "Hello, You recently had jaundice and an enlarged gallbladder, which indicates that your liver may also be affected. Therefore, alcohol consumption is strictly prohibited in your case. Drinking alcohol can not only affect the liver but also cause pain in the bile duct area or the liver itself. Abdominal pain can be difficult to diagnose, especially for someone without medical training, so you should not assume that the problem is related to your gallbladder. In addition to the location of the pain, several other factors are considered when diagnosing abdominal pain. Alcohol can also cause fluid retention in your hands and feet, leading to swelling known as peripheral or dependent edema. Since your pain seems to have developed after drinking alcohol, it may originate in the stomach. You may be suffering from stomach ulcers or gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining), which are being aggravated by alcohol consumption. It is crucial that you do not ignore this problem. I hope this information helps. Best wishes.",

Based on what you have described, it sounds like you have an incomplete fracture of your tibia, as well as an indentation on your lower leg.\n\nThe pain you are experiencing is likely due to the injury itself and the healing process. It's normal to experience some pain and discomfort after a fracture, especially during the first few weeks of recovery.\n\nMetastases to a bone refers to cancer cells that have spread to the bone from another part of the body.

    "1642": "Hi. Thanks for your query. The causes of the lumps in your 35-year-old daughter's armpit could be lymph nodes or sebaceous cysts, as suggested by your doctor. The best way to diagnose this is through an ultrasonography examination by a surgeon. If lymph nodes are suspected, FNAC should be done, and the breasts should be examined physically as well as through mammography and ultrasonography, considering your daughter's age. It is crucial to rule out cancer at any cost, and the best way to do this is by getting a biopsy done, which is both a diagnostic and treatment option if these are cysts or lymph nodes.",

The only known modes of rabies transmission are through the bite of a rabid animal or through the respiratory route, which is very rare. However, raccoons can cause other parasitic infections through the eco-oral route, so it is important to find ways to keep them away from your home. You can consider covering your house with fencing that prevents raccoon invasion. If you have any further concerns, please feel free to ask. Thank you.",

So, it's better to consult a pulmonologist and get a clinical examination of the respiratory system and a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) done. The PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis or asthma, but it will also determine the severity of the disease, and treatment is based on severity.

Based on your history and description, it is my opinion that you are suffering from a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI).

    "1654": "Hi, thank you for providing a brief history of your condition. The symptoms of swelling and pain in your limbs are rare following gallbladder surgery. These issues are more commonly associated with a lack of vitamins or weak metabolism, which can occur after surgery. I recommend discussing this with your surgeon, as it is unlikely to be related to the gallbladder surgery itself. Additionally, you may want to ask your surgeon if it is safe to begin gentle exercises under the guidance of a physical therapist. This can help maintain muscle strength in both your upper and lower limbs. Following gallbladder surgery, it is common to experience weakness in the abdominal muscles due to the incision, and physical therapy may be beneficial in this regard. Best regards, Dr. Jay.",

Excessive coughing can indeed lead to urinary incontinence and urination problems. To address these issues, it's crucial that we focus on treating your cough first and foremost. I recommend consulting a pulmonologist for a comprehensive respiratory system examination, including a chest X-ray and pulmonary function test (PFT). The chest X-ray will help rule out any lung infections, while the PFT will provide insights into bronchitis.

    "1684": "Hello Mr Santos, I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. From what you have described, I understand that you are suffering from \"Portal Hypertension\", which is a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. This condition can lead to either esophageal varices (which can bleed) or ascites (fluid build-up in the abdomen). Cirrhosis of the liver also prevents certain chemicals in the body from being properly purified, which can enter the brain and cause symptoms such as sleepiness and confusion (encephalopathy). The medications you are currently taking, Propranolol and Lactulose, are designed to help manage these complications. Propranolol helps to decrease the portal hypertension and prevents the varices from bleeding, while Lactulose prevents the absorption of these harmful chemicals in the intestine and thus prevents encephalopathy.\n\nThe prognosis for your cirrhosis will depend on the underlying cause. Unfortunately, irreversible damage has already occurred to your liver, and now the focus is on preventing further deterioration and managing complications. If your cirrhosis is due to alcohol use, complete abstinence can help delay progression. However, if it is due to hepatitis, there may not be much more that can be done as anti-hepatitis treatments are not effective in cirrhosis.\n\nAt this stage, the best treatment option for you would be a liver transplant. This would not only remove the cirrhotic liver but also completely resolve the portal hypertension. I strongly advise you to actively seek out a liver transplant center and get evaluated for candidacy for a transplant. I hope this information is helpful, and please feel free to contact me directly for any further details at rxsuresh@gmail.com.",

This assessment would be done by a careful history and examination by your doctor followed by investigations. Irregular periods may indicate that there is an issue with the ovaries, for example, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

While demyelination can cause the symptoms you are experiencing, there are also more benign causes of vertigo and dizziness. Your doctor is ruling out the more serious causes first, which is understandable. Vertigo is commonly caused by inner ear conditions such as Meniere's disease, BPPV, and vestibular neuritis. I hope this information helps and wish you the best.",
    "1709": "Hi, I understand your concern. Given that you and your husband are dealing with infertility, it may take some time for conception to occur as both of your parameters need to normalize. In addition to Metformin, your doctor may also prescribe Camphene for ovulation induction and follicular monitoring, followed by timed intercourse or GUI.\n\nYou can continue using Metformin for as long as needed, as it has been effective for you. However, it is crucial for your husband to achieve reasonable semen parameters. If not, then Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) may be recommended.\n\nFor further management and guidance, please consult an experienced infertility specialist. Remember to maintain a healthy body weight and eat a balanced diet. I wish you both the best of luck on your journey to conceive.",
    "1710": "Hello, Thank you for writing in. The spine is made up of an alignment of small bones. These bones have sponge-like discs between them, and the spinal cord passes along the back of these bones through the spinal canal. Between the bones, we also have nerve roots originating in the spinal cord and passing through foramen between bones. It seems that you have discs at the C4-C5 level that are protruding between the bones, and this protrusion is backwards and causing symptoms. There is also extra bone growth at that level, leading to additional pressure on the nerve roots on the left side. This may also cause obliteration of the lateral recess and neural foraminal compromise. This is leading to pinching of nerves, causing severe pain. You need to be examined by a neurologist, and an MRI of the cervical spine may be indicated to determine if the nerves are under pressure and the location. Some patients experience relief through physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers. Injections are also given for relief. However, this may not always be effective. If your pain is severe and not responding to medical treatment, then the disc protrusion may need to be removed through a small surgery in the cervical neck region. Currently, laser-assisted surgical techniques are also available. I hope for a quick recovery for you. Please do not worry.",

    "1714": "Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Cough, congestion, and chest tightness are common symptoms of bronchitis and lung infections. Therefore, it is better to consult a pulmonologist and have a clinical examination of the respiratory system, chest X-ray, and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). A chest X-ray is necessary to rule out lung infection, and PFT is essential for diagnosing bronchitis. You may need antibiotics and inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol). Don't worry, you will be okay. I hope I have answered your question. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing you good health. Thank you.",

It's definitely not something to ignore, and I'm here to help you figure out what might be causing these symptoms.\n\nBased on your description, there are a few possibilities that we should consider. One is vascular insufficiency, which could be caused by problems with blood flow to your brain or inner ear. This could be associated with certain positions, like looking up or down, so it's important to note if that's the case for you.\n\nAnother possibility is a middle ear infection, which could be causing issues with your balance and coordination. If this is the case, you may need to see an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nGiven the range of potential causes, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact source of your symptoms without more information. However, I recommend that you seek medical attention to investigate further and get a proper diagnosis. Your primary care physician can help coordinate the necessary tests and referrals to specialists if needed.\n\nIn the meantime, try to be cautious and avoid situations that might increase your risk of falling. If you notice any patterns or triggers for your symptoms, make a note of them so you can share that information with your healthcare team.\n\nTake care and please keep me updated on your progress.",

However, without examining the patient and reviewing their blood reports and bone marrow results, it is impossible to accurately predict the outcome of their illness.",
    "1723": "Hello, your brother has a complex and chaotic congenital heart disease with likely single ventricular physiology and reduced pulmonary blood flow. This typically requires multiple surgeries and single ventricle repair, where the single functional ventricle is made systemic and the venous flow is diverted directly to the pulmonary arteries. This is why he underwent a BT shunt to optimize pulmonary blood flow, and then a BDG as the first stage of Fontan repair, where the SVC is connected to the pulmonary artery. Usually, this is followed by another surgery where the IOC is also connected to the pulmonary artery, generally done at the age of 10-12 years. However, in your brother's case, this was not done, possibly because the unbalancing of the ventricles was not severe and one of the ventricles was able to handle at least half of the venous flow. This is known as a hemi-Fontan surgery. I recommend that you take your brother to a pediatric cardiologist and get a detailed echo to assess the function of the BDG shunt and the native ventricles and valves. As he underwent BDG, he needs to be on oral anticoagulation in the form of Acitron. I hope this information helps you.",
    "1724": "Dear patient, Thank you for reaching out. Based on your medical history and recent test results, it appears that you are experiencing respiratory issues due to a combination of factors. The scarring and atelectasis in your lower lobe, as well as the mild obstruction and moderate restriction indicated by your PFT, suggest that there may be underlying lung damage or dysfunction. Additionally, the large gastroesophageal reflux identified by your swallow test could be contributing to your breathing difficulties. While surgery for GERD may help to alleviate some of the respiratory ailments caused by reflux, it is important to manage your expectations. The surgery may only provide limited improvement in your breathing problems, as the underlying lung issues will still be present. However, it is possible that addressing the reflux could prevent further lung damage caused by prolonged exposure to stomach acid. I hope this information helps to clarify your situation. Please feel free to reach out if you have any additional questions or concerns. Regards.",
    "1725": "Hello, this is not accurate. RA (rheumatoid arthritis) is an autoimmune (connective tissue) disease caused by the body's immune system, not by injury. Based solely on a positive Mantoux test, you should not start antitubercular therapy. RA itself can cause pulmonary nodules, fibrosis, and more. Therefore, in my opinion, you should consult a pulmonologist and have a bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis done. If the BAL is negative for TB, antitubercular therapy is not necessary.",

I understand that you had an injury a long time ago in October 2014, so it has been almost a year now, but tendons take a long time to fully heal. During the healing phase of the tendon, immobilization is very necessary. You should rest or minimize the use of that part with a brace or splint. Gradually, the swelling will reduce.",
    "1727": "Hello, I have carefully studied your case and reports. Based on your x-ray report, there are severe degenerative changes in your entire lumbar spine with reduced disc space. These degenerative changes can occur in older age due to deficiencies of calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12.

Additionally, please have your vitamin B12 and vitamin D3 levels checked. I strongly advise you to undergo regular physiotherapy and exercises, as many of my patients have found significant relief through these therapies. You may consult a physiotherapist for guidance. They may suggest transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or ultrasound, which can be beneficial in your case.\n\nInclude calcium-rich and vitamin D-rich foods in your diet. An MRI of your spine may also be necessary. I hope this answers your question. If you have any additional questions or follow-up inquiries, please feel free to ask.

    "1731": "Your condition has most likely been diagnosed by your treating physician as Vitiligo, which is why they have prescribed Tacrolimus and Belgian topical treatments. It typically takes about three months of consistent use before you start to notice any improvement in the color of the white patch. Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant, and it is preferred over steroid applications because it does not cause the affected skin to thin out and has a lower risk of harmful systemic effects associated with long-term steroid use. However, prolonged use of Tacrolimus is not recommended as rare cases of skin cancer and lymphoma have been reported.",

Surgery is still a viable option even if the cancer has spread. The advancements in immunotherapy have also increased survival rates when aggressive surgery is combined with this treatment. Please don't hesitate to seek medical attention.\n\nRegarding surgery at our hospital, we would need to assess your condition and review your medical history to determine if surgery is a suitable option for you.

    "1759": "Hi Shahzad,\n\nThanks for reaching out. I noted that you have elevated liver enzymes, and I understand your concern. To begin with, could you please let me know which medicine you are currently prescribed?\n\nIt's essential to identify the underlying cause of your high ALT SGPT level. We need to rule out possibilities like fatty liver, viral hepatitis, or high cholesterol leading to gallstones. An ultrasound (USG) can help identify if you have a fatty liver or gallstones. Additionally, viral marker tests can help rule out viral hepatitis.\n\nOnce we identify the cause, the enzymes level will take some time to lower with clinical improvement if any of the above causes are present. In the meantime, I suggest making some lifestyle modifications to support your liver health. Avoid a high-fat diet, junk foods, and cut off trans fats from your diet, such as cheese, burgers, meat, and pastry products. Instead, focus on incorporating more fruits, especially green leafy salads, into your diet.\n\nIt's also crucial to avoid smoking and alcohol consumption to support your liver's recovery. You can consider taking Udiliv, which can help manage liver function. If your serum cholesterol level is high, then statins like Chat Doctor can be beneficial.\n\nIf you still don't see any improvement, we may need to investigate further for possible causes like celiac disease or other malabsorption syndromes.

However, it's also important to consider that the medicines you gave him may have caused a reaction. Giving him an antihistamine like Histal could help alleviate the itching if it's due to an allergy. However, if you have already given him Aerius earlier, you should be cautious about giving him another dose of an antihistamine. Only consider giving him an additional dose of Histal if the itching persists despite the previous dose of Aerius. I hope this helps.",
    "1773": "You should definitely see a doctor and get an X-ray done for your cervical spine. Additionally, let me know if you're experiencing any numbness down your arm or feeling giddy. For pain relief, apply a hot pack to your neck and shoulder blade for 15 minutes. Physiotherapy treatments like IT, ultrasonic therapy, and laser therapy can also be very helpful. Once the pain subsides, start doing neck isometrics, shoulder shrugging, and neck stretching exercises. Lastly, make sure you're using a good pillow that supports your neck and head properly. When getting up from bed, turn on your side and rise slowly to avoid any sudden movements. Avoid forward bending, lifting heavy weights, and carrying heavy bags until your pain completely subsides.",

So are you sure that he has Leprosy? Coming to your question, Leprosy is due to infection and not hereditary. It can get transmitted from person to person by close physical contact. If you need to know then he has to be tested (Grandpa). You need to do a split skin smear and look for SEPRA bacilli.

I recommend that you continue giving him ambroxol mucosolvan as it helps to thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier for your son to cough it up. Additionally, you can try giving him a steamy shower or using a humidifier in his room to help moisten his airways and reduce the severity of his cough. As for other medications, please consult with your pediatrician before giving your son any new medicines, especially if he is taking any other medications or has any chronic medical conditions.",

    "1782": "Hello! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor, here to assist you with your query. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to avoid eating food from outside, especially fast and fried food. Additionally, I would recommend a routine stool test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive, as it is often an unexpected cause of stomach problems. Along with this, I would prescribe a probiotic, a proton pump inhibitor, and a prokinetic to aid in digestion. If these measures do not improve your condition, I would refer you to a gastroenterologist for a possible endoscopic evaluation of your intestines. Further management would then depend on the results of the physical examination and investigations conducted by the gastroenterologist.

    "1783": "Hi, I understand your concern about your semen report showing a low sperm count and motility. I suggest that you undergo a more detailed sperm analysis to get a better understanding of the number, morphology, and motility of your sperms. The causes of low sperm count and other sperm disorders can be complex, and the treatment options vary depending on the underlying cause. For instance, surgery is commonly recommended for men with varicocele, which you have already undergone. If the low sperm count is due to infections in the urinary or reproductive tract, antibiotics may be prescribed to clear the infection. Medication and hormone replacement treatment may also be considered if the cause is related to a hormone imbalance. In cases of low sperm motility, assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments can be used to facilitate conception by inserting sperm directly into the female reproductive tract. I hope this information helps you. Please let me know if you have any further questions, and I will be happy to assist you. Take care.",

In young age, hormonal fluctuations can occur, which can lead to fat deposition in breast tissue. This fat deposition can feel like a lump in the breast. However, it is still important to get a mammogram to confirm if it is indeed fat swelling. Additionally, getting hormone levels checked can rule out any hormonal imbalances. Consult a gynecologist for further treatment. If it is determined to be fat swelling, no further treatment is necessary, but treatment for hormonal imbalance may be required. I hope this answers your question. Please let me know if you have any further concerns. Wishing the best of health for your daughter.",

Dizziness and sweating can also be caused by low blood sugar levels. It is advisable to have your blood pressure taken using a traditional sphygmomanometer to avoid errors from digital machines. The arm with the higher blood pressure reading should be considered for medication.\n\nIn terms of your diabetic profile, regular physical activity and exercise can help control your blood sugar levels without relying solely on medication. High cholesterol levels can be managed through diet and exercise as well. Avoiding oil in your diet can significantly reduce your cholesterol levels.\n\nObesity is a major concern for you, and the best way to address it is through a combination of diet and exercise.

    "1794": "Good afternoon! Lazy eye is common in babies up to one year of age, so it's not necessarily a cause for concern at this time. However, the limited use of your baby's right hand could be an indication of a more serious issue, such as paresis or weakness due to a problem in the brain. To encourage your baby to use his right hand, try using bright, colorful objects to stimulate his interest.

I don't know on what basis your doctor has diagnosed him as a case of stomach flu as there is not any suggestive symptom.

The relapse of acne often occurs when medications are not applied properly, not applied for the required duration, or the treatment is stopped midway or irregularly. For optimal results, topical retinoids should be applied at night for six to nine months, as this is the time required to reduce the microcomedone population to a low level. I recommend visiting a dermatologist who can assess your condition and develop a management plan for you. It is important to strictly follow the medication regimen for at least 6-9 months if you want to achieve clear skin and prevent future breakouts. Best regards, Chat Doctor.",
    "1800": "Dear, Based on your follicular study report, it appears that one of your follicles in the left ovary is currently 1.8 cm in size. Typically, a healthy egg is released from the ovary when the follicle reaches around 18 mm in size, with the best chances of successful pregnancy occurring when the egg is released from a follicle between 18 mm to 21 mm in size.\n\nTherefore, it is highly likely that this follicle will rupture and release the egg soon. To increase your chances of conception, I recommend having sexual relations every day or at least every alternate day.\n\nAnother option is to consider an ovulation induction medication, such as HCG 5000 IU, to stimulate ovulation from this 18 mm follicle and timing intercourse accordingly.\n\nI also suggest continuing to monitor the follicle growth through daily ultrasonography and obtaining information on the thickness of the lining of your uterine cavity (endometrium) from your sonologist. An endometrium thickness between 9 mm to 14 mm is considered optimal for implantation of a fertilized egg.\n\nI hope this information provides you with helpful guidelines. Best of luck!",

    "1844": "Hi, Thank you for posting your question here, I will try to answer it to the best of my abilities. If your Implanon expired on the 12th of February and you are experiencing brown discharge, it is possible that this is a symptom of the expired Implanon. However, it could also be caused by other factors, such as unprotected sex or hormonal changes. It's important to note that a pregnancy test done two days ago may not be accurate, as it may take some time for hCG levels to be detected.\n\nI recommend that you schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms and explore possible causes. They may recommend additional tests or exams to determine the cause of your brown discharge.",
    "1846": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your son. In response to your question, I would like to say that life expectancy cannot be predicted as we do not have a detailed medical history. Additionally, science has its limitations, so it is difficult to say what will happen in the future. As your son has autism and a seizure disorder, I would like to ask how active he is and if he is able to move around, walk, run, climb, etc. If he is able to move around, encouraging physical activity may help improve his overall health and potentially his life expectancy. However, in order to make specific recommendations, a physical examination and laboratory tests would be necessary. Medicine can provide symptomatic relief, but ultimately the body must heal itself. For children with autism, working with a team of autism rehabilitation specialists may be beneficial. I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Take care.",
    "1847": "After reviewing your query, I understand your concern. I want to inform you that blood pressure above 180/120 is considered an emergency situation. However, it appears that your machine is providing inaccurate readings. I recommend checking your blood pressure on a different machine. If it is consistently above 180/120, then seek immediate medical attention at the emergency room. Avoid taking any medication until you are certain about your blood pressure level as there is a risk of hypotension if the reading is inaccurate. Best regards.",
    "1848": "Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your symptoms. The pain you are experiencing with eye movement is more likely due to the optic neuritis rather than as a side effect of the spinal tap. While spinal taps can cause post-spinal headaches, these types of headaches typically reduce when lying down, which is not the case for you. Therefore, I recommend that you visit your ophthalmologist to further investigate your symptoms. They may prescribe a course of steroids to help alleviate your symptoms. I hope my answer is helpful. Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions or if there is any additional information I can provide. Wishing you good health.",
    "1849": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. The symptoms and signs you are describing could suggest a sexually transmitted disease (STD), especially if there is associated pain, fever, urethral discharge, and recent sexual intercourse. Therefore, the first step would be to rule out STDs by doing appropriate testing. Secondly, it could also be a sign of reinfection, urinary stones, or some other genital infection, but these possibilities are less common. In any case, antibiotic therapy may be required, so tests should be done as soon as possible so that appropriate treatment can be started. Until then, try to avoid any sexual activity to prevent further discomfort. I hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions, you can contact us at any time. Best regards and wish you good health.",
    "1852": "Hello, congratulations on having a well-grown and nurtured baby. Your baby's diet is perfect, and he is doing very well in terms of weight. It seems that your child has viral diarrhea, which once started, may take 5-7 days to completely resolve. Unless the child has low urine output, is very dull, excessively sleepy, has blood in the stool, or is experiencing green bilious vomiting, there is no need to worry. I suggest giving the child zinc supplements (Z&D Chat Doctor) to aid in their recovery. It is important to keep the child hydrated and continue with their current diet. If you have any further concerns or if the symptoms persist for a longer period of time, please consult with your pediatrician.",
    "1854": "In my opinion, you should stop worrying. For immediate relief, take a painkiller along with a muscle relaxant and rest in bed for a few days. Avoid lying down on a soft mattress and use a hard one instead. As you age, your muscles tend to weaken, so avoid straining or overexerting yourself. You can also apply some good anti-inflammatory painkiller gel to your back. If the pain increases, apply some local heat.",
    "1856": "Thank you for your inquiry. After reviewing your symptoms, it is possible that your wisdom teeth are causing the tension in your jaw, headaches/migraines, sinusitis-like symptoms, and pressure in your ears. I recommend that you consult an oral physician, who can take radiographs to assess the position of your wisdom teeth. If they are not in the proper position, removal may be necessary. In the meantime, you can take a course of antibiotics and analgesics for relief. I hope this information helps. Take care.",
    "1861": "Hello! Thank you for your question. Based on your description, it is possible that you are experiencing symptoms related to your IUD (intrauterine device) or potentially related to other gynecological issues. It is important for you to consult with a physician for proper evaluation and investigation into the causes of your symptoms. The recommended course of action may include removing your IUD if it is causing trouble, as well as investigating the possibility of HERD (human papillomavirus-related esophageal disease) and treating it accordingly. Additionally, a bland diet and avoidance of spicy and non-vegetarian foods may be recommended to alleviate your symptoms. I suggest consulting with a surgeon and physician for further evaluation and treatment. Wishing you a speedy recovery and good health in the future!",
    "1862": "Hello, your age is not mentioned. Skin color is primarily due to the presence of a pigment called Melanin, which is controlled by at least six genes. People with light complexions mostly produce Pheomelanin, while those with dark skin mostly produce Eumelanin. Nature has selected for people with darker skin in tropical climates, especially in non-forested regions. You can try this, but it's not guaranteed to make your skin whiter: avoid direct sunlight during noon hours, apply sandalwood powder mixed with rose water all over your body, and take pure saffron with milk at night daily.",

Based on your symptoms, it appears that you may have a chikungunya infection, which is typically spread through a mosquito bite. This infection can cause flu-like symptoms, high temperature, and joint pain. You can have a diagnostic test done to confirm this. There is an ELISA test available for diagnosis. While there is no specific treatment for chikungunya, in mild to moderate cases, Diclofenac or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used.

I understand your concern regarding your fertility journey and am here to help.\n\nBased on your description, it seems that you have been prescribed medication to aid in ovulation induction, which can increase your chances of conception. The medications your doctor has prescribed, Oveclo Plus and Normoz tablets, are commonly used for this purpose.\n\nAdditionally, your doctor has prescribed Dhphoston 10mg, which is an exogenous progesterone that helps in retaining pregnancy. This medication is often used to support a healthy pregnancy once ovulation has occurred.\n\nWhile I cannot guarantee that you will conceive, the treatment plan your doctor has prescribed is designed to maximize your chances of getting pregnant. It's important to follow your doctor's instructions carefully and to attend all follow-up appointments to monitor your progress.\n\nI hope this information helps to answer your question.

    "1868": "Hi there, Thanks for your question. I'm glad to hear that your C6 vertebra pain is responding well to physiotherapy and daily exercise. Cervical neck pain usually takes 2 to 3 months to reduce, but since you're already making progress, it's likely that you'll continue to improve with time. To further speed up the healing process, I recommend making some posture-related adjustments while working on your computer. Ergonomics is the science of adjusting your environment to fit your body, and there are many resources available online that can help you improve your posture while working at your desk. Additionally, try to avoid sitting or standing in the same position for more than 20-30 minutes at a time, and avoid looking down at your phone for extended periods. These small changes can help maintain good cervical spine posture and promote faster healing. Best of luck!",
    "1869": "Hello, Your report indicates a semen infection with low sperm motility. The presence of excessive pus cells in the semen suggests an infection. You require a proper clinical examination and further investigations. I recommend a routine hologram, RBS, culture and sensitivity of semen, and a colour Doppler of the scrotum. The appropriate antibiotics will depend on the culture and sensitivity report. Your motility is also low, with only 20% motility, while it should normally be at least 55%. However, your sperm count is normal at 30 million/ml, with a normal range being at least 20 million/ml. Improving the infection control is expected to improve your motility. If infertility persists, assisted fertilization techniques can be considered. It is normal for a small amount of semen to come out during urination when straining. I hope for your speedy recovery.

The symptoms you are describing, such as clear white deposits and gum recession, suggest that you may have an infection of the gums called gingivitis.

This cleaning, combined with proper oral hygiene practices, should resolve the issue. I hope this information is helpful to you.",

    "1872": "Hello, Given the moving nature of your pain and the recent appearance of a red, painful patch on your leg, I recommend a blood test to rule out any underlying infection. If there is an infection, it will show up in the blood test results, which will guide us in prescribing appropriate medication. In addition, drinking hot water, modifying your diet, and doing simple general exercises can also help reduce infection and prevent pain. Please get a blood test done.

    "1874": "Hi! Welcome to the Chat Doctor forum. It is likely that you have developed folliculitis due to procedures like waxing or shaving of leg hair, which can lead to dark spots. You can apply a retinoid cream at night over the spot. You can also use a combination cream of glycolic acid and hydroquinone. These will gradually bleach the marks to match your normal skin color, but they take a long time to work. If these methods do not show good results, you can consider laser treatment. The best laser for this would be a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 1064 nm. You may need multiple sessions for optimal results. If you let me know where you are located, I can suggest a laser center for your treatment.",

Your doctor found a mass during the rectal examination, so I advise you to undergo a Colonoscopy Examination as it provides 100% accurate diagnosis at an early stage. Check your Hemoglobin level as you are menstruating and also experiencing blood loss when passing motion. Increasing the consumption of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and reducing the intake of red meat and increasing vitamin D intake is associated with a lower risk of colon cancer. I hope I provided useful information. Please ask further questions to help you get well soon. Regards.",
    "1876": "Hello! Thank you for your question. I understand your concern. It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms improve, to avoid antibiotic resistance. In your case, since you stopped taking amoxicillin early, it is possible that the infection cleared up but then returned, leading to the bladder infection you are currently experiencing. It is advisable to get an urinalysis done to confirm the presence of a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). If a UTI is confirmed, your healthcare provider may prescribe another round of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin 500mg twice a day for 7 days. In the meantime, it is important to drink plenty of water to help flush out the infection. I hope this information helps. Please feel free to provide feedback. Thank you and stay well!",

To address these issues, I recommend maintaining proper hygiene of your scalp and applying vitamin E oil daily after washing your hair. This can help to nourish and strengthen your hair follicles.\n\nIn addition, I suggest consulting a dermatologist for a proper examination.

    "1879": "Welcome to Chat Doctor. The pain you have been experiencing is likely originating from your vertebral column, caused by your inappropriate lying posture. This has caused your vertebral column to straighten, putting pressure on your spinal cord and causing pain along the nerve distribution. To alleviate your symptoms, I recommend correcting your lying posture by using a hard, flat surface like the ground with a low-width mattress. Avoid using spring mattresses. Additionally, consulting a physiotherapist for stretching exercises and taking anti-inflammatory medication can help. Thanks and regards.",

However, if the swelling persists, I would suggest the following:\n\n1. Get an X-ray done to rule out any possible fractures or underlying injuries.\n2. Apply a compression bandage to the affected area to help reduce swelling.\n3. Keep your leg elevated as much as possible to reduce the flow of blood and other fluids to the area, which can help reduce swelling.\n4.

That is a huge achievement and something that you should be proud of. I can imagine that the urge to masturbate may have increased after you quit smoking as your body is trying to find ways to cope with the nicotine withdrawal. However, excessive masturbation can lead to fatigue and fluid loss, which can cause muscular pain as you have experienced.\n\nTo help you overcome your masturbation addiction, I recommend that you stop masturbating for a week and then gradually reduce your frequency to three times a week. This will allow your body to recover and reduce the risk of any further pain or discomfort. Try to find other ways to occupy your mind and hands, such as exercising, reading, or engaging in hobbies that you enjoy.\n\nRegarding your smoking addiction, I suggest that you consult an addiction therapist who can provide you with personalized advice and support.

However, it is important to rule out the possibility of pleurisy, which is an inflammation of the pleura that can also cause chest pain when inhaling. To do this, I recommend getting a chest x-ray. If the x-ray comes back normal, then there is no need for concern and your pain is likely muscular.

Some individuals may experience heavier bleeding with the use of an IUD, especially during the initial months. If this persistent heavy bleeding occurs, the IUD should be removed and an alternative method of contraception should be considered.\n3. Weight gain is not typically a problem with the Copper-T method as it does not contain hormones. Additionally, it is not known to have any negative effects on breastfeeding.\n4. If you are asking about other methods of birth control after one childbirth, there are several options available. You can discuss these options with your healthcare provider to determine which method may be best for you.\n5.

    "1911": "Hi, thanks for asking a question. You have not mentioned whether hepatitis is present or not. For diagnosis of viral hepatitis, viral markers can be done. Here are a few suggestions that might be helpful to you for better relief. Firstly, avoid refined sugar and refined food. Instead, focus on consuming a healthy carbohydrate diet. Additionally, avoid trans fat containing foods like cheese, butter, chicken, beef, pork meat, cake, and pastry. Use minimal oil in your food, and opt for oils that contain omega-3 fatty acids, such as olive oil, sunflower oil, and peanut oil. Regular exercise for 30 minutes, such as running, jogging, or cycling, is also important. Avoid alcohol as it can have negative impacts on your liver health. Garlic is a beneficial food that can be taken early in the morning on an empty stomach as 1 to 2 cloves after peeling. Cumin seed with water is also helpful. With these measures, you will likely see improvements in your liver health. I hope my suggestions will help you. Wish you good health!",
    "1912": "Dear, unless your fallopian tubes are open, there is no chance of natural conception. However, your tubes are not only blocked, but there is also irregularity and beading in the tubes noted in your hysterosalpingogram. This finding is highly suggestive of genital tuberculosis, which affects the tubes. Please get yourself checked by a gynecologist for genital tuberculosis. Also, look for the presence of tuberculosis elsewhere in the body, particularly the lungs, by getting an X-ray. A hysteroscopy will help to have a look at the endometrium for similar lesions. Laparoscopy will provide more information on your overall pelvic health. If tuberculosis is confirmed, you will have to undergo antitubercular treatment. Tuberculosis can definitely be treated completely with treatment and observation, but treatment for tuberculosis is a prolonged process and for genital tuberculosis, you may have to take the medicines for at least 9 months. Along with the treatment, a healthy diet high in protein and calcium with adequate vitamins is necessary. Fresh fruits, fresh green leafy vegetables, and fresh air can help with speedy recovery. If the tubes are affected by tuberculosis, the chances of natural conception are rather poor, as although surgery can restore tubal patency, tubal function may be damaged. So after completing the antitubercular treatment, you may consider artificial reproductive techniques for conception and pregnancy. One more suggestion, as per WHO recommendations and our experience, every case of tuberculosis should be tested for HIV since tuberculosis increases the risk of HIV infection six-fold, and HIV also increases the risk of tuberculosis six times. I feel that you should focus first and foremost on getting healthy. Attempts for pregnancy can be considered later on.",

Therefore, it is recommended that you consult a pulmonologist and undergo a clinical examination of the respiratory system, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and a CT scan of the thorax. PFTs are needed to rule out bronchitis, while a CT scan of the thorax is needed to rule out tuberculosis and acidosis. Please consult a pulmonologist and discuss these options. I hope this answers your question. Wishing you good health. Thank you.",
    "1926": "Hello, thank you for your inquiry about the painful lump of skin on your right middle finger, which you thought might be a wart and has been present for several years. I am glad to see that you are taking this seriously and want to understand what is causing this painful, warty swelling on the corner of your nail that bleeds when you attempt to remove it deeply.\n\nIn my opinion, this painful lump on the corner of your nail is actually a \"Neurovascular Subungual Corn\" caused by chronic, repetitive injury to your right middle fingernail. I would advise against attempting incomplete removal with wart removers, as this will not help remove it from the root.\n\nInstead, I recommend that you visit an emergency room surgeon for proper debridement of the nail-plate bed and removal of the corn from the root in the chronically infected nail-plate. This painful, warty bump is a corny subungual lump arising from chronic, repetitive injury to the infected nail-plate of the middle finger.\n\nDebridement under antibiotic cover from an emergency room surgeon is the recommended treatment. If treated in this way, the patient should not have to worry too much. I hope this resolves your concerns about the painful lump in the corner of your nail on your right middle finger.\n\nPlease take this advice seriously and consider visiting an emergency room surgeon for proper treatment. Welcome to Chat Doctor for any further questions.",
    "1928": "Hi, based on your symptoms, the pain you are experiencing is unlikely to be related to your previous shoulder surgery. Understanding the specific type of surgery you underwent and the reason for it is important. The sharp, electric shock-like pain you describe is typically indicative of pain traveling through nerves, which can occur when the nerve is pinched or compressed. To further investigate the cause of your symptoms, I recommend an MRI of your cervical spine, as well as nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and electromyography (EMG) tests. In the meantime, you can try performing neck and trapezius strengthening exercises for a week and see if your pain level decreases. If it does, this may suggest that the pain is neuropathic in nature, and an MRI would provide valuable insights. With exercise, there is a high success rate in improving these types of symptoms. I wish you good health.",
    "1929": "Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion, you may have a delayed allergic reaction (mild) due to the injection. Intravenous/intromuscular injections can cause delayed reactions (after 24 hours) in susceptible individuals. So you may have a mild reaction. Chest tightness and tachycardia (rapid pulse rate) can be seen in allergic reactions. So your current symptoms may be due to a mild allergic reaction after the injection. Or it could be due to stress and tension. So avoid stress and anxiety. Relax.",
    "1930": "Hello, Children's bones are growing and they are very flexible. This type of pain usually goes away with simple hot water fermentation and elastic bandaging. However, to be on the safe side, an X-ray is recommended as the bones are still in the growing stage and the bone growth plates are prone to inflammation, which is why your son is complaining of pain in the front of the elbow. Taking an X-ray would be preferable. Afterwards, elbow brace support and hot water fermentation are recommended. Slow and low-intensity range of motion exercises along with careful strengthening will help improve symptoms. I hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

Continue using a bronchodilator such as Stalin or Theoasthalin. Nebulization with Stalin will provide good relief for your child.",
    "1932": "Hi, I understand your concern and would like to explain that your diastolic blood pressure values are high, which could indicate the beginning of arterial hypertension. Therefore, I recommend closely monitoring your blood pressure values in the coming days. If your blood pressure values remain consistently high, I suggest consulting your primary care physician for a physical examination and the following tests: resting ECG, complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation, thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, and blood lipid profile. You may need to start antihypertensive therapy. I hope I have answered your question. Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.",
    "1935": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. The backache you are experiencing is not related to your kidneys, but is neurological in nature, resulting from damage to your lumbar or sacral vertebrae that occurred during the car accident. The pain is radiating forward along the sciatic nerve due to compression on the nerve roots, which may be caused by a disc problem. It is recommended that you consult a neurologist for proper management. However, you can use diclofenac sodium along with a vitamin B complex as an over-the-counter treatment. Thanks and regards.",
    "1936": "I understand your concern and frustration regarding your breast issues. It's important to note that sometimes, despite normal test results, individuals may still experience symptoms. It's possible that the bleeding and pain you're experiencing could be related to the removal of your female organs or the development of hep B. However, it's also possible that there could be another underlying cause.\n\nI recommend seeking a second opinion from a specialist in breast health or oncology to explore other potential causes and treatment options. It may also be helpful to request a referral to a surgeon with a whole-body approach, as suggested by your previous doctor.\n\nIn the meantime, try to avoid putting too much pressure on your breasts and nipple area, and keep the area clean to prevent infection. I understand that this has been a long and difficult journey for you, but please know that you have the right to advocate for yourself and seek additional opinions until you receive answers and proper care.",
    "1937": "Hi, thanks for asking a question. Here are a few possibilities: \n\n1. First, if the area over the implant or the skin over the chest is red and inflamed, it could be myositis or costochondritis. The ribs may be painful to touch if there is an infection, and antibiotics may be needed.\n2. Second, it could be simple muscular pain. Take an analgesic for pain relief and rest in a supine position. Avoid heavy exertion.\n3. Third, if you have associated symptoms such as cough, cold, headache, and sore throat, it could be a viral infection. Symptomatic management can be done for it. If the inflammation is severe over the skin, an anti-inflammatory may be recommended.\n\nIn summary, to find out if you have problems with your 18-year-old saline breast implants, you should look for any redness or inflammation over the implant or chest area, which could indicate an infection. If you are experiencing muscular pain, take an analgesic and rest. If you have any associated symptoms such as cough, cold, headache, or sore throat, it could be a viral infection and symptomatic management can be done. If the inflammation is severe, an anti-inflammatory may be recommended. It is always best to consult with a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.",
    "1940": "Hello, Thank you for reaching out to Chat Doctor with your question. After carefully reading your message, I understand your concern. The black spot you are describing is likely a contusion caused by blood seepage. This is a common occurrence and should not cause alarm. It may take one to two weeks for the spot to heal completely. I recommend abstaining from sexual activity for two weeks to allow the lesion to fully heal. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.

    "1941": "Hi, I will do my best to guide you. Kidney transplant is typically performed when creatinine levels are very high, for example, near 10. A creatine level of 2 indicates that the transplanted kidney is functioning, although it is important to correlate this with previous investigations. Another important factor to consider is urine output, which should generally be higher than before. Fever may occur as a result of the immunosuppressants given to prevent rejection. I hope this information helps. After reviewing your senior creatinine and urea reports, the nephrologist will be able to provide you with the best expert opinion. Wishing you good health.",

Milk becomes an optional food ingredient after 1 year of age if the child is given an adequate nutritious diet. At 18 months of age, the child should be given a slightly mashed version of adult food that is low in spices. There is no need to provide milk or health supplements. Yogurt or curd is helpful. If the child has a fiber-rich diet and gets enough exercise, there is no need to worry about diabetes.",
    "1943": "Hello, I understand your concerns. Based on your situation, it is unlikely that you are pregnant. The reasons for this are as follows: 1) You have not missed any pills, and taking them a few hours late does not affect their effectiveness. 2) You have been getting your periods on time, with no delays. 3) All of the urine pregnancy tests you have taken have been negative. While antibiotics can affect birth control pills, not all antibiotics have this effect. Only a few, such as rifampicin and rifabutin, affect hormonal pills. Therefore, there is no need for any blood tests. If you were pregnant, it would still show up on a urine pregnancy test, albeit later than a blood test. Try to relax and avoid stress, as stress about the possibility of pregnancy can also cause pregnancy-like symptoms. I hope this helps. Best regards.",
    "1945": "Hello, the test report suggests that your wife has a hypochromic and microcytic blood picture, which is most often caused by iron deficiency anemia. The test results you provided also indicate the same thing. Since your wife is in her last trimester of pregnancy, oral treatment with iron supplements may not be effective in improving her condition before delivery. The treatment approach will depend on the severity of the anemia, the symptoms it is causing, and your wife's overall health condition. If the anemia is severe and causing significant symptoms, your wife may require a blood transfusion followed by iron injections. I recommend discussing further management with her healthcare provider. Take care.",

In order to provide you with the best possible assistance, I would need some additional information about your health and medical history. Specifically, your age, body mass index (BMI), day two hormonal profile (including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), estradiol (E2), and prolactin), your husband's semen analysis, and results from a hysterosalpingiography (an X-ray exam used to view the uterus and fallopian tubes) would be helpful.\n\nAdditionally, it would be important to know if you have regular menstrual cycles and if you have any existing medical conditions or have undergone any previous surgeries. As an initial recommendation, I suggest having sexual intercourse around the time of ovulation, which typically occurs on days 11, 13, and 15 of your menstrual cycle (with the first day of menstrual flow considered as day 1). If you have not conceived after three cycles, it would be advisable to undergo further evaluations.\n\nPlease provide me with the requested information so that I can better assist you in achieving your goal of becoming pregnant again.

If you would like to examine the above details, we can then consider the necessity of BRCA testing for your daughter.",
    "1960": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. Yes, amoxicillin 500mg could be substituted by cephalexin 500mg to treat a tooth abscess. Cephalexin needs to be used twice a day for 3-5 days only. However, in my opinion, amoxicillin has better results than cephalexin in treating tooth infections or abscesses. But you could take cephalexin if you are not allergic to it and a prescription for amoxicillin is not available at this moment. Also, I would suggest you consult a dental surgeon. Only a course of antibiotics would not be enough to treat a tooth abscess. A root canal treatment or extraction of the tooth may be required. Dental infections tend to recur after stopping antibiotics. Also, long-term usage of antibiotics is not advised to treat dental infections. Therefore, you should make a dental appointment and could take antibiotics until your appointment. Intake of an analgesic like paracetamol/ibuprofen is also advised in case of pain and swelling. Refer to your dentist. Hope this information helps.",

However, in your case, it has not, so I recommend that you see your cosmetic surgeon.

Also, you have not mentioned anything about pain or consistency of the lump. Don't worry, the lump will resolve in some time. But don't overdose yourself with antibiotics.

    "1968": "Hello, thank you for providing a brief history of your condition. I recommend a thorough musculoskeletal assessment. Since you fell on your knee and now experiencing pain when flexing and extending, it could be a meniscal sprain. The meniscus is a ligament in the knee joint, and when it gets sprained, it may lead to these kinds of symptoms. I advise using a knee brace to stabilize the knee joint and rest for a week or two. After that, physical therapy should help regain the range of motion and strength in your knee. With 2-3 weeks of proper physical therapy, you should be fine. In my clinical practice, patients with meniscal sprains recover with physical therapy within 2-3 weeks with full mobility. Regards, Dr. Jay.",
    "1973": "Hello, I am Doctor Chat. In my opinion, I think you may need some physical activity to relieve pressure on your spine and back muscles. Physiotherapy sessions with a good chiropractor, hot massages, spinal straightening exercises, and even yoga can be very helpful in most cases. Try to avoid heavy lifting, obesity, overweight, vigorous movement, bad sleeping or sitting posture, and you will be fine. Long-term effects may include headaches (post-lumbar puncture) which may last for 2 to 3 weeks, back pain or discomfort, bleeding, or brain stem herniation are the most common effects. Try to follow the previous suggestions, and if the pain persists, I recommend an MRI of the spine to rule out any kind of spinal injury such as disc or herniation, and follow up with your neurologist for proper evaluation and management.

So, I recommend getting a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) done. The PFT will not only diagnose the issue, but it will also inform you about the severity of the disease, and treatment is based on severity. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). I don't think it is anxiety. I hope I have addressed your concern.

    "1977": "Hi, from what you've said, I believe your son is experiencing recurrent viral illnesses. Let me explain how viral illnesses work so that you can feel more confident. A fever that lasts for a few days without any other symptoms is likely caused by a viral illness. Typically, what's more important than the fever is your child's activity level between fever episodes on the same day. If your child is active and playing when they don't have a fever, it's probably a viral illness. Once a viral fever sets in, it can last for 4-7 days.

    "1980": "Hello, Thank you for consulting with me. Based on your history, I would like to provide the following suggestions:\n\n1. Before discussing the possibility of future outcomes (prognosis), I would need more information about you, such as your age, health status prior to contracting Swine flu and pneumonia, any allergies, nasal symptoms, other medical conditions, regular medication use, and lifestyle habits. Additionally, information about the cause of your asthma, lung capacity, and allergy testing (if applicable) would be helpful for a proper diagnosis.\n2. Recovery from a serious illness can vary in time and depends on several factors. However, there are measures you can take to speed up the recovery process.\n3. I typically recommend spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing for patients in your situation. This test can provide information about your lung capacity and the type of airway problem you have. It is also necessary to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of asthma or similar diseases.\n4. If you have a history of asthma and allergies, I suggest allergy testing for common airborne allergens such as dust mites, mold, pollen, insect proteins, and animal dander. This will help you identify substances that cause allergies and learn how to avoid them.\n5. Please continue using your current medications. If Atrovent is not effective for you, spirometry testing can help your doctor choose a more suitable inhaler.\n6. Avoid exposure to dust, smoke, and air pollution as much as possible.\n7. Regular physical exercise, including breathing exercises under expert guidance, can gradually improve your lung capacity.\n8. Maintaining a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals can also benefit you in the long run by boosting your overall immunity.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful to you.

Currently, your BMI is calculated to be 28.2, which may pose some challenges in conceiving. I suggest incorporating more high-protein foods into your diet while moderating carbohydrate intake. Feel free to chat with me further if you have any additional questions or concerns. I hope this information helps you.",
    "2007": "Hi, thanks for reaching out. I understand your concerns about your daughter's weight and appetite. At 9 months, it's common for babies to start showing some pickiness with food, but there are a few things you can try to encourage her to eat and gain weight healthily.\n\nFirstly, you can offer her a variety of foods that are age-appropriate and nutritious. You can start introducing stage 2 rice cereals or other similar products, as they provide good calories and energy. Some options include Carla stage 2 rice or Nestum rice stage 2. However, keep in mind that palatability may vary from child to child, so you may need to experiment with different brands and flavors.\n\nIn addition to commercial cereals, you can also try making some homemade food options for your daughter. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Dalia and rice, well cooked and made into an oatmeal-like consistency with the addition of ghee (clarified butter).\n2. Boiled apple or banana, mashed into a paste.\n3. Any whole grain oatmeal preparation with additional ghee added.\n\nWhen introducing new foods, remember to follow these principles:\n\n1. Add one food material, cereal, or fruit per week. This will help you identify any potential allergens or foods that may cause vomiting or diarrhea.\n2. Include vegetables and fruits made into a paste to prevent constipation.\n3. Avoid adding too much sugar as it may cause diarrhea.\n\nBy offering a variety of nutritious foods and following these principles, you can help your daughter gain weight healthily and avoid common illnesses like coughs and colds. If you have any further concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Regards.",

The numbness on the right side of your face, chin, lips, gums, and teeth may be caused by pressure on the inferior alveolar nerve canal from your wisdom tooth or a cystic lesion arising from it. I recommend consulting an oral physician and getting a radiograph or CBCT to rule out any pathology. If a cyst is present with the wisdom tooth, then enucleation of the cyst with removal of the wisdom tooth is recommended. Please consult an oral maxillofacial surgeon for removal. If I were your treating physician, I would also suggest taking nerve-regenerating medication. I hope my answer is helpful to you, take care.",

Apart from the antihistamine that you are already taking, I would suggest you take montelukast once daily for one month. Research has shown that it considerably decreases allergic symptoms. If the problem persists, then I would suggest you undergo allergy testing at an allergy clinic. It will determine what specific thing you are allergic to. The results will help an allergist to prescribe immunotherapy for that specific allergen, and it will improve the problem. I hope this answers your question.

    "2023": "Welcome to ChatDoctor. In newborn babies, it is common to see variations in the frequency, color, and consistency of their stools. Therefore, there is no need for concern at this time. Your child is currently in the transition phase from meconium to yellowish brown stools, which is a normal process as the gut gets colonized by healthy bacteria from the environment. However, if you notice that your baby is lethargic and not feeding well, has watery stools that do not improve within the next 2 days, or is experiencing any other symptoms such as fever or decreased urine output, then you should consult with your doctor. In the meantime, continue to breastfeed your baby with proper burping techniques and ensure that they are receiving feeds completely from one breast before switching sides to ensure they receive both foremilk and hindmilk. Position and attach your baby to your breast properly during feeding. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.",
    "2024": "Hello! I understand your concern. Based on your description, it seems that your son sustained an injury to his cheekbone due to a fall, resulting in bruising and a black eye. While the bruising has resolved, there is still a hard lump underneath the skin at the site of impact, which your son reports as sore to the touch.\n\nThis lump is likely due to inflammation and hematoma formation, which occurs when blood vessels rupture and spill blood into the surrounding soft tissues. The inflammation can also lead to the proliferation of fibrous tissues and the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the area, which can encapsulate the hematoma and contribute to the hard lump.\n\nWhile the black eye was caused by blood accumulation due to ruptured blood vessels, the bruising has since subsided as the accumulated blood disintegrates. However, the lump formed due to inflammation and hematoma formation takes longer to resolve, but there is no need for concern as it will gradually subside.\n\nI recommend consulting a physician to evaluate for any underlying bony fractures, as reduction and fixation may be necessary if a fracture is present. If there is only soft tissue injury, you can apply alternate warm (not hot) and cold packs over the swelling. The use of thrombophob gel containing heparin sodium can also aid in faster dissolution of the hematoma. For pain relief, Tylenol or eugenic kid can be administered.\n\nI hope this answers your question. If you find the response helpful, please consider writing a positive review and clicking \"find this answer helpful\" as a token of appreciation. Thank you and regards.",

However, only 5% of your sperm are rapidly motile, which is an important factor for fertility. The liquefaction time, which should be less than 30 minutes, is also not mentioned in the report. To improve sperm motility, I recommend consulting an infertility specialist for a proper examination before taking any medication. Avoiding hot water baths, managing stress, increasing your intake of fruits and green leafy vegetables, and staying hydrated can also help increase sperm motility. I hope this answers your question.

This typically occurs when the baby eats too quickly and swallows air in the process. The discomfort will persist until the air is released through burping or flatus. Generally, I don't recommend any medications for this as they only provide temporary relief. The two most effective ways to alleviate this distress are: 1) Avoid putting the baby in a lying position after feeding until they burp out the swallowed air. 2) If the baby continues to cry, place them in a prone position and gently pat their back to help them pass gas and find relief.

Since your dentist has taken x-rays and confirmed there is no infection in your tooth, and the pain subsides when you go to bed, it is likely that the issue is stress-related.

    "2049": "Hi, thanks for reaching out. Based on your description, it seems like you are experiencing pericoronitis, which is inflammation of the gum flap that covers or lies behind the wisdom tooth. This inflammation is often caused by food getting trapped between the gum flap and the wisdom tooth, leading to swelling and pain. Brushing your teeth may provide temporary relief by reducing the amount of bacteria in the area, but the pain and swelling will eventually return as bacterial counts increase and acid production increases. I recommend that you see a dentist for an evaluation, and if your wisdom tooth has not fully erupted, an x-ray may be necessary. In the meantime, you can take antibiotics like Augmentin 625mg three times a day, anti-inflammatory medication like Ibuprofen 400mg three times a day, and an antacid like Pantoprazole 40mg once in the morning on an empty stomach. Do this for five days and also gargle with warm salt water. Chlorohexidine gargles can also be helpful. If the condition improves, great, but if it persists, then an x-ray will help determine the best course of treatment, which may involve surgically removing the gum flap (operculectomy) if the wisdom tooth has fully erupted, or extracting the tooth if it is impacted. I hope this information helps, and please give me a five-star review if you found the answer helpful. Thanks and regards.",

PFT is needed for the diagnosis of asthma or allergic bronchitis, while a chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection.

    "2058": "Hi, thanks for consulting with Chat Doctor. A fever that lasts for a few days without any localizing signs is likely caused by a viral illness. The child's activity level between fever episodes is more important than the fever itself. If the child is active and playing when they don't have a fever, it's probably a viral illness and doesn't require antibiotics. Viral fevers can last for 4-7 days, so don't worry too much about the duration if the child is active. You can give paracetamol in a dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6 hours, but only if the fever is over 100F.

Based on the information provided, it seems that your daughter has been experiencing lower back pain and tummy aches since August, with blood present in her urine. Urine tests also showed protein, which prompted a scan that revealed a cyst with a shadow in the middle.

A pediatrician is now recommending a rescan due to concerns about the unusual shape of the 2cm cyst with a shadow in the middle.\n\nUnfortunately, I would need more information regarding the specific blood test result and value you mentioned in order to provide a more accurate assessment.

    "2072": "Hello, thank you for providing your medical history. I recommend a thorough clinical examination followed by some routine blood tests. Swelling in the feet and pain behind the knee can be caused by a variety of factors, and we cannot immediately conclude that it is due to thyroid dysfunction. Often, we need to consider differential diagnoses based on signs and symptoms and compare them with laboratory findings. If it is thyroid dysfunction, blood tests should show possible changes and provide a basis for diagnosis. Additionally, in my clinical experience, physical therapy can be effective for treating swelling and pain behind the knee. Best regards.",
    "2073": "Hello, It is my pleasure to help you. As you had generalized urticaria, your doctor prescribed medicines to control your symptoms. The symptoms will improve with the completion of the course prescribed by your doctor. The hiccups you are experiencing will resolve by themselves in a short period of time and are rarely a medical emergency. If the hiccups are disturbing your eating or sleeping habits, then you should consult your doctor. To control these hiccups, you can follow some home remedies: holding your breath, pulling hard on your tongue, biting on a lemon, or gargling with water. A physician may prescribe medications such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and metoclopramide for severe, persistent hiccups. I hope this answers your question. Thank you.",
    "2075": "The doctor's response to the patient's question can be rewritten and translated into English as follows:\n\n\"Hello, thank you for asking. Your brother has hepatitis C, which may lead to cirrhosis. Due to cirrhosis, there may be variable bleeding from the rectum. Banding can be done for esophageal varices. As the kidney is shutting down, it suggests hepatic disease-induced functional kidney failure, possibly caused by hepatomegaly. Slurred speech indicates the development of encephalopathy. Therefore, the prognosis seems poor. Consult a surgeon for care. If needed for portal hypertension, beta-blockers can be taken. Follow a low-salt and low-fat diet. Take one teaspoon of licorice with honey. If needed for encephalopathy, antibiotics such as Aureomycin or rifaximine can be taken after estimating blood ammonia levels. Increase fruit intake, such as papaya. Take care.\"",
    "2079": "Dear patient, Thank you for reaching out to me regarding your father's dog bite incident. I understand your concern. Based on the information provided, there are no specific dietary restrictions following a dog bite. However, it is essential to complete the full course of Rabies vaccination and get a tetanus shot as well. If your father experiences any local swelling or signs of infection, it is advisable to seek medical attention and possibly get antibiotics for cellulitis. This is my professional recommendation based on the details you have provided. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask. Best wishes for your father's speedy recovery. Stay healthy!",
    "2092": "Thank you for your inquiry. Please clarify what you mean by \"your heart is out of sync\"! Does it beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly? Qvar (beclomethasone) and Spirit can be taken together. Spirit may increase your heart rate. COPD is a chronic disease that requires long-term therapy for the person to feel and stay better. In your case, you should feel relief quickly as you have more receptive and healthier lungs compared to those with COPD. I recommend that you talk to your doctor to confirm the safety of Spirit for you. I hope this helps. Please feel free to get back if you need further clarification. Wish you good health.",
    "2093": "Dear patient, Thank you for reaching out to me with your concern. I understand that you are experiencing pain in your lower right abdomen, which worries you that it could be appendicitis. However, please know that vomiting is only one of the symptoms of appendicitis, and its absence does not exclude the possibility of the condition. The best course of action to rule out appendicitis is to visit a hospital for a blood test and an ultrasound. Additionally, the pain you are experiencing when breathing could also indicate other conditions such as cholecystitis or gastric disorders like hiatal hernia or HERD. I recommend that you seek medical attention to properly diagnose and treat your symptoms. Wishing you good health. Sincerely, Dr. Ivan Comic",
    "2167": "Hi, I have gone through your question and I can understand your concern. You may have some soft tissue tumor like dermatofibroma or some other mass lesion. I would recommend that you go for an ultrasound study first to determine the exact location and origin of the lump. If needed, a biopsy of the lump can be done to give you an exact diagnosis. Once you have a diagnosis, you can discuss treatment options with your doctor. I hope this answers your question. If you have any further doubts, please feel free to ask. Thanks for using Chat Doctor and I wish you the best of health.",
    "2168": "Hi, First, your father can take one tablespoon of flaxseed oil with his meal, or he could eat grilled fish three times per week. He could also take an iron supplement tablet twice per week after meals, for example after lunch on Monday and Friday. In addition, a vitamin B complex once per day after meals, folic acid 500 micrograms once per day before a meal, coenzyme Q10 three hours after meals once per day, and benfotiamine 40mg twice per day after meals every day can help him. However, these natural methods cannot replace medical treatment. Your father should consider taking antidepressants, but you should consult your doctor about the suitable options.",
    "2173": "Hi, I have gone through your question and can understand your concern. You have been diagnosed with early-stage invasive ductile carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma, with all lymph nodes clear except for two lymph nodes in your breast under the lobular carcinoma. You have had a bilateral mastectomy and 23 lymph nodes removed from your left side, with tutors on the left breast and the right breast clear.\n\nIn terms of post-operative treatment, chemotherapy is usually recommended based on the stage of the cancer. Since your cancer is positive for estrogen and progesterone, you should also consider treatment against these hormones. This can involve medication such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors.\n\nIt is important to consult with your doctor to discuss the best treatment plan for your specific situation. They will be able to take into account factors such as the stage of your cancer, your age, and any other medical conditions you may have.\n\nI hope this information helps, and please don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions. Wishing you a speedy recovery and good health.",
    "2175": "Before I tell you the causes of increased bilirubin in the blood, let me explain what bilirubin is. Bilirubin is a yellow-colored pigment that the liver produces due to the breakdown and recycling of red blood cells, so it is a byproduct of the breakdown of hemoglobin. Increased levels of bilirubin in the blood can be caused by sickle cell anemia, allergic reactions due to blood transfusions, liver diseases such as acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, liver damage, obstructions in the gallbladder, hemodialysis, side effects of medications, and pancreatic cancer. To determine the exact cause, consult a gastroenterologist for necessary investigations and treatment. In the meantime, I suggest following a soothing diet and regular exercise to maintain your health. I hope this answers your question. Take care and get well soon.",
    "2176": "Hi, Welcome to Doctor Chat. Yes, the treatment you are receiving is appropriate. Clomid helps multiple follicles to mature and rupture, increasing the chances of pregnancy. Progesterone helps maintain early pregnancy and also aids in the growth of the endometrium. Additionally, I would recommend going for intrauterine insemination (IUI), where healthy sperm are placed directly into the uterus, as this will increase your chances of pregnancy. I hope this information is helpful. Regards, Doctor Chat.",
    "2177": "Hi, Thanks for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about your father's illness, especially since you are away from him. Given his age and current condition, it's natural to be concerned about his well-being.\n\nThe main factors to consider in your father's case are his serum creatinine and blood urea levels. If these levels have remained stable over the past three weeks, it suggests that his kidney function has not deteriorated further. However, if they are unstable, it indicates that he is at risk of developing renal failure in the coming weeks.\n\nAdditionally, it's crucial to monitor his response to pneumonia treatment. Certain medications used to treat pneumonia may have adverse effects on his overall health, particularly given his current kidney function. Therefore, discussing the above two points with his healthcare team is essential to understand his prognosis and recovery from pneumonia, considering his kidney function.\n\nI hope this information helps you make an informed decision about whether to return to Sydney from the far north coast. Please keep in mind that I am a Nephrologist providing general guidance, and it's essential to consult with your father's healthcare team for personalized advice. Best wishes for your father's recovery. Regards, Dr. [Your Name]",
    "2191": "Dear friend, thank you for sharing your concern. As you are in the pharma sector, you must be aware of a condition called oral submucous fibrosis, which causes restricted mouth opening along with oral lesions. Antibiotics like Cipro will not help in this case. I strongly advise you to quit tobacco chewing completely as it can further aggravate your problem. It is good to know that you have started taking care of your health. In the meantime, maintain good oral hygiene and avoid spicy food. Keep a close eye on the lesion and check for any progression. If you notice any changes, you must visit a dentist. Otherwise, the lesion should recover on its own with the discontinuation of the tobacco habit. Chewing gum can help promote salivation, so keep a piece in your mouth and chew it regularly. Thank you.",
    "2198": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Given your history of smoking, we should definitely rule out lung-related diseases (such as bronchitis) as a possible cause for your symptoms. I recommend consulting a pulmonologist and undergoing a clinical examination of your respiratory system as well as a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT). The PFT will not only help diagnose bronchitis, but it will also provide information on the severity of the disease, which is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment. Most likely, you will be prescribed inhaled bronchodilators (such as formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (such as budesonide or fluticasone) to manage your symptoms. Try not to worry, and rest assured that these treatments will help improve your condition. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Wishing you good health. Thanks."
