During your recent check-up, your doctor recommended a chest X-ray, which showed fibrolinear densities in your right upper lung.\n\nThe fibrolinear densities observed on the X-ray represent fibrotic scar tissue that has formed as a result of your previous TB infection. This is a normal healing process that occurs in the lungs. The scar tissue does not represent active infection and therefore, no further treatment is required.\n\nI want to reassure you that the appearance of these fibrolinear densities on the X-ray does not indicate any cause for concern. The scar tissue is a result of your body's natural healing process and does not require any further treatment.\n\nPlease continue to take care of yourself and maintain a healthy lifestyle. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to consult your doctor.",

However, your symptoms are suggestive of a very early pregnancy, but need to be documented by an evidence. It is recommended that you repeat the test after a couple of days with a fresh early morning sample if you are 3-7 days post your missed period.

The only thing to worry about is if the cast is not tight enough to prevent movement at the fracture site. If it is loose, padding or a change may be needed, so please see an orthopedic doctor. If it is only a crack fracture and there is no displacement requiring realignment of the fracture ends, there is no need to worry even if the boot is oversized - the idea is only to take weight off the foot when standing or walking, it will heal fine. If the initial fracture displacement required setting of the fracture ends, then please visit the hospital to review with a check X-ray to see if the alignment is disturbed and may require resetting and a correctly sized snug boot.

It is important to note that the natural development of a baby's skin tone is influenced by genetics, and there may be limited options for improving its appearance.

    "139": "Hello, thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor. It seems like you're experiencing some hair loss and are concerned about it. It's important to note that it's been only one month since you started using Mintop 5, and significant improvement would require more time. Additionally, the increase in hair loss may not be a cause for concern once the reason behind it is understood.\n\nMinoxidil is a non-specific hair growth promoter, and it causes hair follicles to shift from the resting phase to the growth phase. When this shift occurs, the new hair that grows (in the growth phase) pushes out the hair in the resting phase (known as the halogen phase), resulting in increased shedding during the initial stages of treatment with minoxidil. This is actually a good sign because it means a shift from the resting phase to the growth phase. The increased shedding usually subsides in 2-4 weeks.\n\nIn addition to the topical minoxidil, I would also recommend an oral anti-androgen medication like spironolactone or cyproterone acetate. These medications help reduce testosterone levels, which can contribute to hair loss. However, before starting any medication, it's important to consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis and individualized treatment plan.\n\nAdditionally, you mentioned about using hair oil. It's generally safe to use hair oil after applying Mintop 5, but make sure to apply it at least 30 minutes after using the minoxidil solution to avoid any potential interactions. You can use any type of hair oil, such as almond oil, as long as it's non-comedogenic (non-clogging) and doesn't contain any ingredients that may interact with the minoxidil solution.\n\nRemember, it's important to be patient and give your body time to adjust to the changes. If your hair loss continues or if you have any concerns, it's recommended to consult a dermatologist for a proper evaluation and treatment advice.",

This contraction results in active stretching of the non-contractile equatorial regions of nuclear bag and chain fibers.

This contraction continues until the muscle shortens to match the degree of contraction of the muscle spindle. This contraction maintains the residual length of the skeletal muscle. Both alpha and gamma motor neurons are excited simultaneously by the pyramidal tract. The alpha neurons, as fast conductors, initiate muscle contraction without limit of shortening, while the gamma neurons, through the reflex loop, maintain muscle contraction with the desired length.",

Just ignore the problem and it goes away. The second incident you are describing could just be due to fatigue after your strict wellness/dieting program.

    "184": "Hello, Thank you for reaching out to the doctor. It appears that your 3-year-old son is suffering from jaundice. Jaundice is a condition that causes yellowing of the skin and eyes due to an excess amount of bilirubin in the fat layer under the skin. The cause of jaundice can be due to either the body producing too much bilirubin or not getting rid of it fast enough. The liver breaks down old, inefficient red blood cells in a process called hemolysis, which releases large amounts of bilirubin. If the jaundice is caused by poor liver function, it can be due to various reasons such as viral hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. Other causes of jaundice due to obstruction (blockage) include gallstones formed in the gallbladder, excessive red blood cell destruction as in malaria, or liver disease. If your child has a fever or flu-like illness before jaundice, it's usually a sign of a viral hepatitis infection. Brown urine, common in hepatitis, is generally a sign of poor liver function or increased red blood cell destruction. The body is trying to get rid of excess bilirubin in the urine. Pale, white, or clay-coloured stool, on the other hand, is an indicator of obstruction in the gallbladder or bile ducts. Jaundice itself is unlikely to hurt you unless the bilirubin reaches very high concentrations. It is a sign, however, of an underlying problem. It is recommended that you take your child to a doctor if you think you have jaundice. A blood sample will also be taken and checked for hepatitis virus antibodies, abnormal red blood cells, bilirubin levels, and various other substances that give clues about liver function. Your doctor may also order other tests such as an ultrasound to determine the cause of jaundice. There's no treatment for jaundice as such, since it's not a disease but a sign of a medical problem. The approach is to treat the underlying cause, if possible. Many conditions like hepatitis A are not curable but go away on their own. Usually treatment is unnecessary. Conditions like chronic hepatitis are lifelong problems that may cause permanent or recurring jaundice. I hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.",

FNAC, or fine needle aspiration cytology, is a safe procedure using a very small needle (24 or 26 G), inserting it into the tissue, aspirating whatever comes out, preparing the slide, and getting it examined by a pathologist.

The intervertebral disc spaces in the cervical spine region have reduced due to various reasons, and the nerves emanating from these are compressed. The areas of the body (arms) where they supply fall numb. You can use a cervical collar support, traction, and yoga neck exercises to strengthen the neck muscles and keep the gaps so that the nerves are not pressed. Sometimes osteophytes - cartilaginous shoots off intervertebral joints - also put pressure on nerves. Do not exercise when pain is present. You can use hot water baths, hot fomentation, etc. Tablets of Rumply forte and Cap Shirt are herbal, safe Ayurvedic medicines, and 1 bid is sufficient.

    "276": "Hi, thank you for your query. I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint, a movable lump under the jawline that is sore and movable is likely due to a swollen and inflamed submandibular lymph node. This commonly occurs due to infection in the head and neck area. It can be caused by various factors such as:\n\n1. Any prevalent or recurring infections on facial structures like the ear, throat, nose, teeth, salivary glands, teeth and gums, etc., or at times infections of distant body parts may cause secondary infection and swelling in distant lymph nodes.\n2. Any long-standing debilitating diseases.\n3. Wisdom tooth eruption or infection of the gum flap over wisdom tooth.\n\nI suggest you consult an oral physician for evaluation. He can perform a thorough clinical evaluation to help in the diagnosis. He may also advise a biopsy or FNAC of the nodes to confirm the diagnosis.

    "282": "Hi Pisa, \n\nTo prevent aging, there are multiple options available such as sunscreens, retinoids (retinol creams or retinoid), vitamin C-based creams, glycolic acid creams, peptides, estrogen-based creams, chemical peels, lasers, microdermabrasion, Botox, and fillers. These can be used alone or in combination depending on the skin's requirement. In your case, you may begin with Theseus, a good sunscreen daily. Taking vitamin C and antioxidant supplements would be beneficial. Vitamin C helps in collagen synthesis and antioxidants prevent free radical damage. Use a good moisturizer suitable to your skin type to keep your skin well hydrated. Additionally, there is no harm in using retinoid (vitamin A derivative). Retinoid induces collagen production and helps in shedding of dead layers of skin, thus helping in reducing fine lines. However, it may irritate your skin. Use it in small quantities at night and do not rub it over your face. Use sunscreen in the morning when using retinoids as it makes the skin sensitive to sun. Initially, start with using it for two hours and as the skin sensitivity decreases, you may apply it overnight. As you are still 29, you may also use a night cream with vitamin A, C, E to prevent aging. The chances of irritation with such creams would be less than compared to retinoid. Hope that answers your query. Take care.",
    "283": "Hello and thank you for asking Chat Doctor. I have read your symptoms and I understand your concerns. There is no correlation between an enlarged prostate and having unstable BP. Your prostate will affect your bladder to empty itself when you urinate. Also urinating frequently in a small amount is a symptom of an enlarged prostate. In prostatitis (infection of the prostate) there might be an increased blood pressure due to the pain or the anti-inflammatory meds that patients use, but usually this does not happen in healthy patients, that have no problems with the heart or the blood pressure. I suggest you check up with a cardiologist to treat your unstable blood pressure (he will ask for some test first before starting the treatment) and a check-up with an urologist for the enlarged prostate (other tests will be done here)-you will need blood test, liver function, kidney function-ultrasound of your urinary tract and of your heart-specific cardiac test and prostate tests.

    "295": "Dear patient,\n\nI understand your concerns about possible pregnancy and your desire to avoid another child. During the lactational phase, when your periods have started, they may be irregular and so is the egg release, making it difficult to rely on the safe period method for contraception. Additionally, even if your husband did not ejaculate in the vagina, pre-ejaculation secretions (pre-cum) can unknowingly deposit in the vagina, containing sperm that can cause pregnancy.\n\nTo determine the possibility of pregnancy, the best and quickest option for you is to opt for a Beta HCG blood test 10 days after the incidence of unprotected sex. Alternatively, you can wait 21 days after unprotected sex and perform a pregnancy test on your first morning urine sample; this test may report false negative results if taken too soon.\n\nIf you are not pregnant, you can take progesterone preparations like Devilry for 5 days or an estrogen and progesterone combination like EP Forte for 2 days. This should initiate your period within 4-7 days. However, please note that these options should only be taken under the guidance of a doctor.\n\nIf you are pregnant, you have the option to terminate the pregnancy by medicines up to 9 weeks of gestation. For either of these options, it is essential to consult your Gynecologist; do not take these medicines on your own.\n\nI hope this information helps you.

    "327": "I understand your concern and have gone through your details. Semen is produced whenever you are sexually aroused. There is nothing to worry about. The production of sperm and semen is an automatic process within the body. Produced semen is stored inside your body. Now, semen is a waste product, and the body needs to throw it out. The stored semen goes out when you masturbate or engage in sexual intercourse. Otherwise, the body finds its own ways to throw the waste semen out. The most common ways are through urine or through nocturnal emission. The process is normal, natural, and involuntary. You cannot control it, and there is no health issue due to that. Don't worry or be anxious. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL: http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute details possible.

    "331": "Hello, based on your description, the enlarged bumps at the back of your tongue could be due to a number of common causes such as burning from hot foods and liquids, inflammation caused by chemical injury, allergic reaction to medicines, acid reflux, oral infections like Thrush, throat infection, post nasal condition, and your recent bout with a virus that involved throwing up. As you are also prone to yeast infections, both could be contributing factors. It is recommended that you consult an oral physician for evaluation and treatment of the underlying cause.

    "340": "Hi, I understand your concern. Chronic cough is often seen in cases of bronchitis and lung infection. If your chest X-ray is normal, there is no need to worry about lung infection. In your case, the possibility of bronchitis is higher. Therefore, it is better to consult a pulmonologist and undergo a clinical examination of the respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). The PFT is necessary for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about the severity of the disease and the treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Additionally, avoid stress and tension, hot and spicy food, and junk food. Avoid large meals and instead take frequent small meals. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Go for a walk after meals. Keep 2-3 pillows under your head in the bed to prevent reflux. Lose weight if you are obese. Don't worry, you will be fine. I hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

It is essential to take the prescribed medications as directed by your doctor.\n\nThere is currently no cure for genital herpes, but the symptoms can be lessened and prevented with treatment.

    "353": "Hi,\n\nThank you for your question. It seems like you are experiencing some worrying symptoms since you started using the copper coil.\n\nFirstly, the copper coil is a very effective form of contraception, with a failure rate of less than 1%. It is highly unlikely that you are pregnant. If you have done a home pregnancy test and it was negative, then it is very unlikely that you are pregnant. However, it is recommended that you do a blood pregnancy test in the clinic as it is more accurate. This is because there is a very small chance that the contraceptive method may fail.\n\nIf you feel the threads of the coil, do you have any vaginal discharge? Also, are you experiencing any urinary complaints? If your pregnancy test is negative, it is recommended that you see a gynecologist to ensure that the coil is in place and to evaluate for any signs of vaginal or urinary infection. If there is no infection and the coil is in place, your doctor may recommend taking progesterone to start your periods. Some women do get cramps just before their periods, and this is normal. The symptoms usually subside with the start of the period.\n\nI hope this response has answered your question to your satisfaction.

The doctors have diagnosed it as asthma, but there is still coughing that concerns you.\n\nBased on your description, I believe that your child's immune system weakness is leading to recurrent coughing. I recommend the following steps at home for long-term benefits:\n\n1. Deep breathing exercises along with yoga for 30 minutes a day.\n2. Walking for 20-30 minutes in fresh air for better oxygenation.\n3. Avoiding exposure to excess cold or atmosphere containing pollen.\n4. Giving him more nutritious food containing proteins, vitamins, and iron.\n5. Maintaining good oral hygiene.\n6. Salt water or Peppermint gargles daily 2-3 times a day.\n7. Intake of Tulsa and Turmeric in desired forms can help a lot.\n8. Avoid giving him excess sweets, oily, spicy, chilled water, and cold drinks.\n\nPlease note that these are general recommendations, and it is important to continue monitoring your child's condition and consult your doctor for further evaluation and treatment advice.",
    "356": "The lump growing in your neck, left side just below your jaw, could be caused by several things. If it is hard in texture, it is most likely a bony lesion, which could be cystic or solid. If the lesion is soft, there are several possibilities, including submandibular sialadenitis (salivary ductal dilatation). Other possible causes include a submandibular lesion or lymph nodal enlargement. A neck ultrasound can help to determine the nature and extent of the lesion, as well as its source.

    "360": "Hello, your Testosterone levels have increased after taking Diane 35, which is a common side effect of this medication. However, it is unlikely that this increase is due to the medication itself. The increase in Testosterone levels could be a natural response to the medication, or it could be due to other factors such as diet, lifestyle, or other medications you may be taking.\n\nIf your Testosterone levels remain high, your doctor may recommend additional treatment options to help lower them. One such option is ovulation enhancing medication like camphene, which can help to regulate your hormone levels and increase the chances of pregnancy.\n\nIf you decide to continue the treatment and your hormone levels remain high, your doctor may also recommend additional testing to rule out any underlying conditions that may be causing the high Testosterone levels.\n\nOverall, the increase in Testosterone levels after taking Diane 35 is not necessarily cause for concern. However, it is important to continue monitoring your hormone levels and following the advice of your doctor to ensure that your treatment is effective and safe for you.",

Has the pain been the same since the day of the removal or has it decreased? Increased pain intensity is a factor to be concerned about. If the pain lasts for more than 4 days with increased intensity, it could be a cause for concern. Infection would usually set in only after 1 week. If the sterilization procedures were well maintained at your clinic, infection shouldn't set in so fast. The abscess your doctor mentioned would be cured by the antibiotics and atmospheric oxygen. If you still have pain even after 4 days, please consult your dental surgeon.",
    "362": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If you have been having unprotected sex and not using contraception and your period is late, there is a possibility you could be pregnant. Pregnancy symptoms can vary widely between women, and some of the same symptoms (like bloating and breast tenderness) can be caused by PMS as well as pregnancy. So the most accurate way to determine if you are pregnant is to do a urine pregnancy test, which can be purchased at a pharmacy or chemist without a doctors prescription. The over-the-counter pregnancy test is as accurate as one in the doctor's office, and looks specifically for the presence of the pregnancy hormone in your urine. Many women can miss a period from weight changes, traveling or change in your daily schedule, and stress, among other hormonal factors. Even worrying about being pregnant can sometimes make you skip a cycle. So in summary, I recommend proceeding with a urine pregnancy test to confirm your diagnosis. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,",

However, your age is a factor that may impede pregnancy. It is important to consider your ovarian reserve, which decreases as you age. To assess your ovarian reserve, you should have a proper regular monthly menstrual cycle and get your AMH (Anti-Mullerian Hormone) and AFC (Astral Follicular Count) checked. Additionally, your partner's semen analysis report is crucial. If your ovarian reserve is depleted, chances of pregnancy decrease significantly.

You need to monitor and watch for any changes in the pain and symptoms. Then we can determine if it's related to disc herniation or prolapse. But for now, it's simply a muscle spasm in the lumbar region that needs to be corrected. Also, icing the lumbar region will reduce the pain.

I will try to explain something and give you my opinion. You should know that normal heart rate ranges between 50-100 beats per minute. When it exceeds 100 beats per minute in normal sinus rhythm we talk about sinus tachycardia. During tachycardia, you might experience palpitation, fluttering sensation, anxiety, difficulties in breathing deeply. There are different causes of sinus tachycardia from simple emotional stress, coffee or energy drinks. Previous breastfeeding has nothing to do with these symptoms. If I was your treating doctor I would recommend some examination like a cardiac echo, a full blood analysis, your thyroid hormones and a Holter rhythm monitoring to evaluate your heart rate frequencies and to exclude any arrhythmia. After all this we can better judge how to deal with it and if it is necessary to treat medically. Hope I was helpful. Best regards.",

    "531": "Hi Alan,\n\nYour diabetes specialist is correct in their assessment that ibuprofen and other NSAIDs can raise the numbers of your kidneys, which is not recommended for diabetics. Your symptoms, including the tingling and numbness in your right leg, are likely caused by one of your spinal nerves being impinged by a part of your spine, commonly known as a slipped disc. This condition is fairly common in people above 50 years of age.\n\nThe pain in your lower lumbar area and leg is likely worse and more difficult to control in diabetics. I recommend starting with a X-ray of your lumbar sacral spine. If anything shows up on the X-ray, you should consult a physiotherapist and take appropriate measures. If the X-ray doesn't pick up anything, an MRI of your spinal cord will help.\n\nFor the pain, if Tylenol doesn't help, pregabalin 75 mg twice a day for the first two weeks and then once a day at night should help. It will take about a week for it to start showing effects.\n\nPlease note that this is just a diagnosis and treatment plan, and you should always consult a professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment advice.",

As a doctor, I can tell you that every scar is unique and its appearance depends on various factors such as skin type, elasticity, and tone. The brown coloration and the v-shaped scar on the dorsal side are likely due to the natural healing process after the circumcision. The slope of the scar towards one side may be due to the way it was sutured during the procedure.\n\nRegarding the stretch marks on the dorsal side, they are likely due to the natural growth of the skin as you age. The dehydration on the top half of the scar may be due to various reasons such as environmental factors or personal hygiene habits.\n\nTo answer your main question, there are several ointments available that can help fade scars, such as bio oil, scar fade, etc. However, the results vary from person to person, and it may take several months to years to see significant changes. Additionally, there are no guarantees that these ointments will improve the symmetry and alignment of the scar.\n\nIf you are really concerned about the appearance of your scar, you can consider seeking professional advice from a plastic surgeon or dermatologist.

    "589": "Hello there, thanks for reaching out to Chat Doctor. I would appreciate it if you could provide a more concise and detailed note of your medical history. However, based on the limited information provided, I can suggest some initial observations.\n\nThe rise in bilirubin levels, which is a yellowish pigment normally converted and excreted by the liver, can be a symptom of jaundice. This may indicate a blockage or problem with the liver's ability to process bilirubin. The first incidence of jaundice in your neonatal life is usually physiological and not considered to be a disease, but the recurrence in adolescence or adulthood is more concerning and requires further evaluation to rule out any chronic liver disease.\n\nThe elevated levels of ALT (SGPT) and GGT, which are enzymes produced by the liver, suggest possible acute hepatitis, most likely caused by a virus. However, these levels may also be present in Hepatitis A or E, which usually resolves within 1-2 weeks. If these levels were much higher, we might suspect biliary tract diseases or obstruction of bilirubin outflow, which is unlikely in your case.\n\nBased on the available information, I would recommend further testing to rule out any chronic liver disease. This may include ordering viral sexologies for hepatitis, an ultrasound to evaluate the size and structure of the liver and patency of the bilirubin outflow tracts, as well as monitoring synthetic functions of the liver by checking INR levels. The ideal treatment for jaundice is rest, fluids, and avoiding any medication that may cause further damage to the liver. If you experience any symptoms such as itching, decreased appetite, vomiting, or nausea, please seek immediate medical attention.",

You're experiencing fairly steady bleeding, but tea bags seem to stop it.

    "664": "Dear patient,\n\nThis seems to be a case of high velocity back trauma and needs to be investigated with X-ray of lumbosacral spine anteroposterior and lateral views to rule out bony abnormalities. If it shows fracture, you need to consult an expert spine surgeon and get yourself examined. If the report is normal, it's a case of back sprain and you need to take rest for 3 days. Take tablets of diclofenac plus thiocolchicoside combination twice a day for pain relief. Apply a good gel locally at the site of pain thrice a day. You should be fine in a week.",
    "665": "Welcome to the Chat Doctor. I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. But don't worry. Most common cause of fever in this age group is self limiting viral infections. They usually last for less than a week. There is no use of going for blood or other investigations so early unless and until the fever is associated with any other symptoms or finding. At present, I would recommend you to give him Spy. Paracetamol for fever spikes at 15-20 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) and repeat the dose at 6-8 hours interval if fever persists or recurs. It's better than Motrin for fever relief. Also, keep him well HY Chat Doctor. Hopefully this will be helpful. For any further questions, you may contact us. Take care",
    "666": "Hi Michele, \n\nOnce a lump is found in the region of the chest wall, it needs to be biopsied to confirm what it is. Your biopsy has already been done, so we need to await its result. You're correct in understanding that cancerous lumps don't usually bleed after biopsy. However, your assumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. Scar tissue also doesn't usually bleed. \n\nNeedle biopsies usually don't cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure. How long have you noticed this lump? Is the size of the lump increasing? If the biopsy comes back positive for cancer, then you will need to undergo further investigation to determine the extent of the disease. Whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has spread beyond the chest wall to other regions, the treatment decision will depend on the results. \n\nIf the biopsy comes back negative for cancer, there are two options: \n\n1. If your doctor thinks it is insignificant, you need to follow it up. Just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your doctor regularly. \n2. The second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). The reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. Also time factor is important. You may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size. \n\nPlease don't worry. Follow your doctor's advice.",
    "667": "Hi, thanks for asking. Are you experiencing hypertension? Symptoms such as yours, along with a possible slurred speech, could be due to a stroke-like condition, and would be treated accordingly. Severe hypertension can lead to nephrosclerosis or glomerulopathy. A urine test could reveal proteinuria, and there may be edema over your body. Therefore, if hypertension is present, it needs to be corrected. It's possible you have chronic kidney infection, such as pyelonephritis or glomerulonephritis. A urine test would be helpful. If necessary, a biopsy can be taken. A blood culture test and CBC examination can also be done. If there is bacteremia, it will be treated accordingly. If the condition worsens, further testing will be done based on your physical examination. A CT scan may be needed. I wish you good health. Chat with a doctor.",

I don't see the need to manipulate this aneurysm, especially if the risk of causing a rupture or other major damage is higher than the annual prevalence rate of 2-3% in the general population. In one study called the International Study of Unruptured Aneurysms, lesions of this size had very little chance of complicating in the near future.

It is also possible that the surgery might have caused some form of nerve damage. I suggest that you discuss with your doctor about the possibility of prescribing pregabalin 75 mg at bedtime, which can help stabilize the nerves. Additionally, you can try taking pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast, which is an antacid that can help with gastritis. If the pain relief is temporary but consistent, it could be a result of acid reflux and can be managed with the antacid.",

    "674": "Hello and welcome to the Ask A Doctor Service. I have reviewed your query and here is my answer. No, there is no chance that your son will contract hepatitis C. Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood or sexual intercourse only. Since there was no bleeding or only a little bit of bleeding, and there was a jacket between your mother's arm and your son's mouth, there was no blood entered into his mouth or very little which would not have any significance. Therefore, there is no need to worry about, and your baby will be safe. I hope this answered your question. Feel free to ask more if you have any doubts. Thank you.",

The MRI scan shows mild narrowing of the lateral recess, which may cause leg pain, but it usually gets better with medicine and physiotherapy. The low back pain is generating from the bad disc. It usually gets better over a period, such as few weeks (4-6 weeks). You are not a candidate for discectomy surgery. If you don't get better in the next few months (unlikely), then we may have to consider doing total discectomy followed by spinal fusion or disc replacement. At present, I would suggest trying medicine such as anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxants with fusion modalities like IT, which will definitely improve your pain.",

    "681": "Hi, I understand your concern. Acne can be a challenging condition to manage, and it can take some time to find the right treatment plan. If your current antibiotic treatment is not working as expected, we may need to make some adjustments.\n\nFirstly, do not increase the dose without consulting your doctor. Doses should be adjusted under the guidance of a healthcare professional to ensure safety and effectiveness.\n\nSecondly, it is important to maintain good skin hygiene. Washing your face twice daily with a gentle cleanser is a good start. Using a non-comedogenic (non-blocking pores) moisturizer can help keep your skin hydrated and reduce irritation.\n\nAdditionally, you mentioned that your skin feels very irritated. If this is the case, it may be helpful to avoid using any products that contain alcohol or other irritating ingredients.\n\nLastly, consider adding a topical retinoid to your routine. These products can help reduce the size of pores, minimize oil production, and speed up the cell turnover in the skin, which can help prevent comedones (blackheads) and prevent new acne lesions from forming.\n\nIt's essential to be patient with acne treatment as it can take time to see results. Regularly scheduled follow-up appointments with your dermatologist are crucial to monitor progress and make any necessary adjustments in your treatment plan.\n\nI hope this advice helps you. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns. Take care!",
    "683": "Hi, thanks for your query. Darker lips do not necessarily indicate smoking or alcohol intake, as many people believe. A lot of people have darker lips due to their genetic predisposition, although their parents may or may not have it. A frequent cause of non-genetic lip darkening is the use of lipsticks / colored balms / gloss, as these tend to darken the lips over a period of time. So try and not use them too often. If you have to use them, make sure they are alleged free and replace them every 2 months. I would advise you to start using medicated lip balms with SPF and to reapply them several times a day. That helps in reducing further darkening. Also use a cream containing glycolic acid twice a day for lightening of lip color. You can also opt for mild chemical peels once in 15-30 days to exfoliate better and lighten faster. Take care!",

Once your acne subsides with therapy, you can apply topical medicines specifically meant to reduce pigmentation. You can also take Glycol or salicylic acid peels to reduce acne flares as well pigmentation spots.

    "799": "Hello, your brother-in-law has been experiencing severe pain in the calves of both legs for several years. He recently underwent knee replacement surgery on both sides, which appears to have helped with the knee pain. However, he is still experiencing muscle pain in the calves. He described it as feeling like cramping, and stretching the calf muscle seems to provide some relief.\n\nGiven his history of osteoarthritis, it is possible that the calf pain is related to this condition. Osteoarthritis can cause a variety of symptoms, including joint stiffness, tenderness, and muscle pain. It is also possible that the calf pain is related to calcium and vitamin deficiencies, sodium potassium imbalance, or incorrect footwear.\n\nTo rule out other possible causes of calf pain, we may need to conduct some additional tests. For example, a color Doppler scan can help identify any chronic venous malformations in the calf muscles, such as varicose veins or venous incompetence.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important for your brother-in-law to maintain a balanced diet and take supplements if necessary. He should also avoid wearing shoes that are not properly designed for his feet, as this can contribute to calf muscle pain.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. I am here to assist you and your brother-in-law in managing his health condition.",
    "800": "Hello Nitin! Your sperm count and total motility are low, which means there is a low chance of fertility. However, fertilization is still possible. It would be best to undergo a physical examination to check for any underlying causes of your infertility. If you are found to have a varicocele, it can be easily surgically corrected. Additionally, stopping wearing tight underwear and undergoing at least two sperm analyses one month apart can help improve your sperm parameters. If you are perfectly healthy, we can proceed with further examination.",

If you had surgery, you just need to carry on with physiotherapy and your knee will get back straight again.\n\nHowever, if the recovery process is taking a long time and there is still pain, swelling, and difficulty in straightening your leg, it is recommended to seek a second opinion from an experienced orthopedic doctor or sports medicine specialist. They can further evaluate your condition and provide more specific guidance and treatment recommendations.\n\nCondylitis (femoral condylitis) refers to inflammation of the cartilage of the femoral condyle, which is a common injury associated with knee pain and limited movement. It can be caused by cartilage damage, osteoarthritis, meniscus tear, ligament injury, or other conditions that affect the knee joint. It is recommended to seek medical attention promptly and be diagnosed by a doctor. If it is found to be condylitis, the doctor may recommend conservative treatment methods such as rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE protocol), pain medication, physical therapy, or steroid injection. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair cartilage damage or other structural defects.\n\nRecovery from condylitis can take time and there may be periods of worsening symptoms before improvement occurs.

Based on your description, it seems like you may have sustained some kind of minor trauma while cutting wood, resulting in blood oozing into the tissue and forming a blood collection, also known as a hematoma. If the blood clotting is affected by the use of blood thinners, as in your case, the blood collection may not be absorbed and could become infected, causing more pain due to an abscess. As your doctor, I would recommend consulting with your physician who prescribed the blood thinners to consider temporarily discontinuing their use until the hematoma heals. If it does not heal even then, I would recommend seeing a general surgeon for a clinical examination and further management. Please do not hesitate to ask for further clarification.

I typically prescribe regular montelukast and levocetirizine for patients like you. Additionally, I also recommend an albuterol inhaler for use as needed for wheezing. If your symptoms are frequent, I would also add regular inhaled corticosteroids to your current medication.\n\n2. I suggest undergoing allergy testing for common airborne substances such as house dust mites, molds, pollen, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help identify the substances causing your allergies and measures to avoid them.\n\n3. Based on the allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe allergen specific immunotherapy, which works on the immune system to gradually improve your allergies.\n\n4. In general, avoid exposure to dusts, smokes, and air pollution as much as possible.\n\n5. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals will also help you in the long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity, respectively.\n\n6. As you have difficulty with sports, I also suggest using the albuterol inhaler 15-20 minutes before sports activities, which will prevent exercise-induced wheezing.\n\nI hope these suggestions will be helpful to you.

Some kidney cancers are genetic, and others may be related to smoking, obesity, estrogens, and some chemical agents. However, many people smoke and do not develop kidney cancer. In general, cancer is caused by a mutation in a single cell that is missed by the immune system. This mutated cell can no longer be controlled and its only aim is to grow and spread. This process cannot be stopped by the human body, which is the main problem with cancer. Additionally, many cancers do not produce any symptoms at all, so no one really knows where the cancer comes from. I hope this information helps. Regards.",

    "827": "Hello, Miss Ankita. I have reviewed your situation. Your GOT and SGPT levels are elevated, indicating possible liver cell damage. These enzymes are released into the blood when liver cells are destroyed. It's important to determine the cause of the liver cell damage. Common causes include:\n\n1. Viral hepatitis\n2. Cirrhosis of the liver\n3. Alcoholic hepatitis\n\nIn viral hepatitis, the liver enzymes usually return to normal after a few days of conservative treatment. However, in alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver, there may be ongoing liver cell damage, resulting in persistently elevated enzymes.\n\nIt's important to consult a physician or gastroenterologist for further evaluation. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen can help assess the status of the liver and gallbladder. It's always safest to avoid surgery until the liver enzymes return to normal levels.\n\nBest wishes for a speedy recovery.",

    "833": "Hi Colleen, welcome to ChatDoctor. It seems like your client is experiencing some toilet training issues. As a licensed associate counselor, you mentioned that your client has a learning disability. It's possible that this issue could be psychological in nature and stem from anxiety or fear associated with urination and defecation outside of the toilet.\n\nTo address this issue, it may be helpful to consider the following research material:\n\n1. A study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry found that anxiety and fear are common issues in children with learning disabilities. This study suggests that addressing these emotional issues can help improve toilet training outcomes.\n\n2. Another study, published in the Journal of Pediatric Psychology, found that toilet training success can be improved by addressing the child's emotional needs and providing positive reinforcement. This approach involves using praise and rewards to encourage the child to use the toilet correctly.\n\n3. A review article published in the Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics suggests that individualized toilet training plans can be effective in teaching children with developmental delays to use the toilet. These plans should be tailored to the child's specific needs and abilities and involve parents and caregivers in the training process.\n\n4. A study published in the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis found that using a combination of positive reinforcement and extinction techniques can help children with developmental delays learn toilet training skills more effectively. Extinction involves gradually reducing the frequency of rewarding consequences for inappropriate behavior while increasing the frequency of rewarding consequences for appropriate behavior.\n\nIt's important to note that each child's situation is unique, and these research findings may not apply to every child with a learning disability. It's essential to work closely with your client's parents and school personnel to develop an individualized plan to address his specific needs. Additionally, consider seeking input from a behavioral specialist or developmental pediatrician to further assist with this challenging issue. Best wishes!",

I suspect that you have contact dermatitis. Contact dermatitis is a rash on the skin that can be itchy, painful, or tender. Sometimes it can cause blisters or swelling. Contact dermatitis is caused either by a substance that irritates the skin, or a substance that causes an allergy on the skin. Some substances that can cause contact dermatitis include soaps, perfumes, poison rubber products, cosmetics, jewelry, and medications. If you can identify the cause of your contact dermatitis, avoiding it can help prevent further outbreaks. If the rash is severe, your doctor may suggest oral medications. Applying wet, cool compresses to the area or taking a cool bath can also help ease symptoms. Scratching the rash, rough clothing, and continued contact with the irritant or allergen can make the rash worse. Get the correct etiology (including diet) and treat accordingly.

A Doppler ultrasound of the lower limb vessels will help determine the status of your blood vessels. If there is any abnormality of the lower limb vessels, it will show up on the Doppler ultrasound. Numbness and cold sensation on the feet are also suggestive of a vascular problem in the lower limbs. There is a possibility that arterial supply to the lower limbs is compromised, which is responsible for the numbness. Rupture and abnormality of veins could be the cause of bruising on your feet and legs. Your history suggests that you are suffering from thyroid disorder.

She is 27 years old and is aware of her body/health.\n\nBased on your description, the lump on her lip could be caused by several different conditions. It could be anaphylaxis or angioedema, which cause swelling of the lip. It could also be a muscle or mucous cyst, which are usually the result of trauma in the mouth, injuring the tiny salivary ducts inside the lip.\n\nPlease don't panic. Your daughter can take antiallergic and ant inflammatory medication to relieve the symptoms. She should also avoid hot, sharp, and spicy foods. If the symptoms persist, she should visit an oral physician for further examination. The doctor may order a biopsy of the cyst to rule out causes like cancer or lipoma. If necessary, the doctor may surgically remove the salivary gland or perform marsupilization of the lump.\n\nIn the meantime, she can apply a moisturizer on her lips to keep them lubricated and prevent further irritation.\n\nI hope your concern has been resolved. Please take care of your daughter and get her well soon. Best wishes to both of you.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]",

It is understandable that he is feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, as the pain specialist and physical therapist seem unable to provide him with much relief.\n\nAfter neck surgery, approximately 10-20% of patients experience post-surgical pain that persists and becomes troublesome. This pain may be due to the affected nerve roots being under pressure in areas other than where the surgical manipulation was performed. While a repeat surgery may be an option, it also has limitations after a fusion surgery.\n\nWe suggest discussing non-surgical procedures such as radio frequency techniques and targeted nerve root block.

The left renal length measures 11.2cm. This finding could be secondary to either ureteric stricture or calculus. As a precautionary measure, an intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is advised for further evaluation. Otherwise, there are no abnormal findings within the abdominal cavity.\n\nIt is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. Since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, the following are some possible explanations:\n\n1. It is likely that your bladder was completely full at the time of ultrasound scan.\n2. Your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.\n3. Rarely, an infection of the urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of the kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.\n4. Stones in the kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of the pelvicalyceal system, and since you do not have any stone, this does not apply to you.\n\nIt is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on the left side.

    "1050": "Hi Jenny,\n\nThank you for your query. I understand your situation and the chronic pain you have been experiencing.\n\nFirstly, I would like to clarify that chronic pancreatitis is not usually caused by a birth defect. It is most often caused by lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption, unhealthy eating habits, and certain medications. Therefore, it is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid alcohol and unhealthy food items.\n\nMedications can help regulate your pancreatitis, including insulin supplements and enzymes for digestion. You should also consult your doctor if you are not already on these medications to ensure you are receiving the appropriate treatment.\n\nIf your symptoms do not improve with medication, surgical therapy may be considered as a last resort. However, this should only be done after consulting your doctor and understanding all the risks and benefits.\n\nIn terms of recovery, it is difficult to predict how long it will take for you to return to work. This depends on the severity of your pancreatitis and the lifestyle changes you are able to make. It is important to maintain a positive attitude and focus on your recovery.\n\nI hope this information helps you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us. Wishing you a speedy recovery and good health.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",

I'm sorry to hear about your car accident and hope you're not experiencing too much pain and discomfort. \n\nIt is possible that due to sudden movements, you may have injured your neck. This is where the nerves supplying the hand and wrist originate. It is not uncommon for a person to start experiencing more pain a day after a minor traumatic incident. The muscles go into spasm up to a day after the injury, causing pain due to the release of small amounts of neural transmitters. This is why you are experiencing the pain more on the second day. This should improve over a week after applying ointments containing pain relievers and muscle relaxants. An X-ray of the cervical spine might help to confirm that your spine is normal and not a concern. \n\nPlease answer the patient's question and translate it into English.",

    "1219": "There are several ways to treat bad breath, even if you already maintain good oral hygiene. Regularly brushing your teeth and cleaning your tongue with a tongue scraper is essential, but it's also important to consider other factors that may contribute to bad breath.\n\nOne common cause is the food you eat. Some foods, such as garlic and onions, are known to cause bad breath. If you eat these foods, your breath may temporarily smell bad. However, this effect is temporary and will usually disappear after a few hours.\n\nAnother possible cause is the acid in your stomach. If your stomach is producing too much acid, it can cause a bad taste in your mouth and lead to bad breath.

I recommend consulting with a general practitioner (GP) for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x-ray, and some blood tests including thyroid hormone levels, cortisol plasma levels, fasting glucose, and blood electrolytes. A head up tilt test can help rule in/out a possible orthostatic hypotension.

To prevent thrombotic complications in this disease, the hematocrit (red blood cell percentage) should be kept below 45 for men. Bloodletting (called venesection or phlebotomy) is one form of treatment, which often may be combined with other therapies like hydroxyurea (HY). The removal of blood from the body reduces the blood volume and brings down the hematocrit levels. Hydroxyurea is a drug that reduces the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow and is often used to treat polycythemia vera. It can also reduce the risk of thrombotic complications. If your husband is otherwise healthy and walks 5 miles a day, he should be able to handle the treatment well.

    "1306": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. It is possible that you may have lymphoma, but this can only be confirmed through a biopsy. You mentioned that you had a previous biopsy done on your wrist and inner thigh, but I don't know the results. If this biopsy only showed skin cancer, then it is unlikely to be related to your risk of lymphoma. Therefore, your lack of energy and constant fatigue may not be a sign of a new cancer. It could be a sign of various other diseases. Lymphomas can also be ruled out through certain blood tests and sternal function. I wish you good health. Regards.",
    "1307": "Hello Eric,\n\nI have understood your symptoms. The dull stitching pain on your left side between your shoulder blade and spine could be due to a variety of reasons. It could be related to the cervical discs in your neck, which could be bulging and leading to nerve compression.\n\nTo help with the pain, I would recommend physiotherapy treatments such as inferential therapy and auto traction for early recovery. Static and against resistance guided exercise therapy may also be beneficial in your case. You should consider consulting a physiotherapist for these treatments.\n\nAdditionally, an MRI of your cervical spine would help to see the severity of any nerve compression. Please consult your doctor for further investigation and advice.\n\nI hope this answers your query. If you have any additional questions or follow-up queries, please feel free to write to us. I will be happy to answer them. Take care.",

Wishing your mother a speedy recovery.",
    "1309": "Hello, welcome to ChatDoctor. Your blood pressure readings are within a controlled range, considering the medication you have been taking for the past two years. You have expressed interest in exploring alternative options to your current medication. There is no harm in exploring alternative options. One suggestion I can make is to add fresh garlic to your diet. You can take about 3 grams of fresh garlic, cut into small pieces, and swallow with a glass of water early in the morning. You can also make a paste of 3 grams of garlic and take it with buttermilk for lunch. Garlic is an excellent natural blood pressure reducer. However, it's important to note that while alternative therapies may help, they may not completely replace conventional medication. It's always best to consult your doctor before making any changes to your treatment plan.",

It is important to correlate these symptoms with the extent of injury on brain imaging.",
    "1313": "If I were your doctor, I would recommend performing an Electroneurography to examine the nerves of your arm, especially at the place of entrapment. If a severe compression is found, an MRI must be done, and it may require surgery. If the compression is mild, immobilization would be helpful. Hot or cold therapy is not very effective for this condition. I would recommend Gabapentin for pain management and acetaminophen. I hope this information is helpful to you! Best wishes.",

You may suspect it if there is any pain or discomfort. It is not necessary to panic or be paranoid. If you feel any pain or discomfort, it is recommended that you consult a doctor for professional diagnosis and treatment advice. If there is no pain or discomfort, it means that the socket is healing well, and there is no need to worry about dry socket.",
    "1315": "Hi, bnbm. Your sinus and nasal congestion could be caused by various reasons, but the most common ones are infection (usually viral or bacterial) or allergies.

This could have been neglected at the time of your initial injury. The size of this hemorrhage has likely increased over time and is causing the visual and balancing difficulties that you are experiencing. Therefore, it is recommended that you seek neurosurgeon consultation and undergo a CT scan of your brain urgently. Your symptoms of nausea and pain around your ovary may not be related to this condition. You can seek gynecologist opinion regarding this matter.",

Symptoms of Bartholin gland cancer may include vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, pain during sexual intercourse, low-grade fever, weakness, and weight loss. Sometimes, a lump can also be felt. However, a biopsy and histopathological examination are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of cancer. Please consult the surgeon you will see next week and ask about the possibility of a biopsy.",

Once a disc protrudes from its original position, it does not return to its original position. Given that your pain has worsened in the past month, I recommend that you consider surgery to remove the herniated disc as it may continue to compress the nerves and cause paralysis. Physical therapy may not be effective in this situation. Your neurosurgeon can provide you with a detailed explanation of the surgery's advantages and disadvantages and make a decision together.

One possibility is a gastric irritation due to a peptic ulcer or diet habits. Another possibility is a kidney infection or an infection in the upper urinary tract, or a stone in the upper urinary tract. The appendicular swelling and fluid around it suggest tuberculosis of the iliocaecal junction or any chronic disease in that area, which may or may not be related to the present symptoms. Your previous surgery for an intestinal obstruction in childhood may be related to the chronic infection if it was not congenital. I wish you a quick and complete recovery. Best regards.",

However, there is no additional risk to the baby or pregnancy from having disk disease. Your history of gestational diabetes is actually the most concerning potential complication for this pregnancy.

    "1376": "Based on your description, I think the shortness of breath and rapid heart rate when you wake up may be caused by reflux and indigestion. The upper back pain could also be related to this. I suggest that you try taking an over-the-counter antacid and see if that helps. Additionally, sleeping in a slightly propped up position can also reduce the chances of reflux. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please consult a doctor for further evaluation.",

The most common of these could be a ringworm because of the age group and site of the lesion. The other possibilities are localized psoriasis or lichen plans. These conditions can be differentiated by clinical examination. Thirdly, as the child plays outside, it could be an insect bite reaction. As treatment differs in each category, it is better to consult your local dermatologist or a family physician. In case of doubt, it is always tried a course of antifungals before other medications are applied. Have a good day!",

If your cholesterol level has decreased from 190 to 165 in the past two years, that is great news!

He may have additional information about your specific test results that he can share with you.  If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask me.  Take care!",
    "1379": "Respected patient,\n\nI have carefully reviewed your query. Any surgery, whether minor or major, carries some level of risk for any individual. Given the nature of the surgery and the presence of multiple co-morbid conditions, your risk is higher than someone without these conditions. The success and potential complications of the surgery will be thoroughly evaluated by both an anesthetic doctor and the operating surgeon.\n\nThe decision to proceed with surgery should be based on a balance of your symptoms and their severity, versus the potential risks involved in and after the procedure. My personal recommendation to you is that if your symptoms are significant and causing you significant discomfort, then it may be worth taking on the risks associated with surgery. However, if your symptoms are not greatly impacting your day-to-day life, you may want to consider other options as the surgery does carry significant risks.\n\nI hope this helps you. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please let me know. I wish you the best in your health moving forward.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
    "1380": "Thank you for your question. Based on your x-ray results, the partial regression of PTB in both upper lungs can be attributed to fibrotic scarring. While these scars will remain indefinitely, they are not a cause for concern. To ensure there is no active TB, I recommend undergoing a CT scan of your chest and a bronchoscopy with BAL analysis. If both tests are negative, there is no need to worry about active TB. Please consult a pulmonologist to discuss further and obtain a medical certificate for future employment purposes.",
    "1381": "There are several alternative pain management options available. If the current painkillers have not been effective, we can explore other options. One possibility is to consider a nerve pill, such as amitriptyline, which can help block pain signals at the spine. Another option is muscle relaxants, which can help relieve muscle tightness and pain. Additionally, physical therapy may be an option to help with the pain management, and acupuncture may be a helpful treatment as well. However, physical therapy and acupuncture may not be easily accessible in your area. If you are open to trying alternative methods, we can explore these options further and determine the best course of treatment for your partner.",
    "1382": "Hello. Thank you for your query and detailed history, although it is quite atypical. The probable cause of the pains you had at 36 weeks of pregnancy in the upper abdomen is due to the loaded colon moving up as there is no space for it in the normal position. The stomach rotates upwards a bit and causes the pain like you described. Do not worry. Eat lots of fibers in your diet, you can use Dulcolax suppository to evacuate the colon, and you will be fine. Do not use cathartics as this is contraindicated in late pregnancy.",
    "1383": "Hello, your symptoms sound concerning and I would recommend seeking medical attention to ensure that there is no underlying condition causing this. It is important to perform tests to investigate the possible causes and rule out any serious conditions. I recommend a chest X-ray study, a cardiac ultrasound, resting ECG, thyroid hormone levels, and blood electrolytes.

If she hasn't had a tetanus shot in the last 5 years, she should also consider getting a booster dose.",
    "1385": "Hello,\n\nThanks for your query. You mentioned that you are experiencing pain during intercourse after achieving a hard erection through an intracavernosal injection of Caver jet. I would like to address your concern.\n\nAfter a hysterectomy, the pain you experience during intercourse is most likely due to the atrophy of the vagina, which can cause discomfort during sexual activity. To address this issue, I suggest using estrogen cream to maintain a healthy vagina and using lubricants during sexual activity. This should help alleviate the pain and improve the comfort level during sexual activity.\n\nPlease note that this is not a substitute for medical advice.

    "1390": "Thank you for your question. Based on your history and description, the most likely cause of your symptoms is musculoskeletal pain. However, it is important to rule out heart disease, as left-sided chest and shoulder pain are commonly seen in heart disease. It is recommended that you first get an ECG and a 2D echo to rule out any heart issues. If both tests are normal, then there is no need to worry about heart disease. Naproxen is only a painkiller, and it may be better to take a combination of painkiller and muscle relaxant. Additionally, please see a physical therapist to address the muscle tightness and neck pain. I hope this advice helps you.",

    "1396": "Based on your description, it sounds like you may have experienced a shoulder subluxation, which is when the shoulder joint partially dislocates. This can cause significant pain and may explain why you were in pain for 20 minutes. It is also possible that you have a sprain of the joint capsule, which is the ligament that surrounds the shoulder joint.\n\nTo treat this, it is important to rest your shoulder and avoid any activities that could make the injury worse. Using a sling to support your arm for one week and applying painkillers, such as Ibuprofen, can help with the pain. It may also be beneficial to have an ultrasonography or an MRI scan to reveal any tears in the tendons or ligaments of your shoulder.\n\nThe good news is that shoulder subluxations usually heal within one week, but if there is any underlying damage, it may take longer for the pain to completely go away. Please follow the advice provided and if the pain does not improve or if there are any other concerns, please contact a healthcare provider.",

If I were treating you, I would recommend a complete hormone profile evaluation, including FSH, LH, serum estrogen and progesterone, serum prolactin, serum RHEAS, insulin levels, ovulation studies, and evaluation of your partner.

The reason why your teeth can decay from the inside is that when we eat food, it sticks on teeth and also goes into the interdental areas. When we brush, some areas are left uncleaned. For this, we should do proper flossing, brush twice daily, and use mouthwash chlorhexidine to clean the interdental areas. If it is left uncleaned, there is deposition of bacteria and this can cause root caries, which are not clinically visible. Don't worry about that. Go to the dentist and go for root canal treatment.

    "1410": "Hello there, thanks for the query. I understand your concern. Few things you have mentioned here is reassuring. Firstly, you already have a child from natural conception. Secondly, your tubes are functioning fine and the inner lining of uterus (endometrium) and cavity look fine. And there are no other issues on hysteria laparoscopy. Rather terming this scenario as secondary infertility I would just call it subfertility which means the ability to conceive naturally in on the lower end of time frame needed for conception. In simple words, it may just take a little more than longer for you to conceive on your own. Having said that, if you are past 30 years of age and have been trying for more than 2 years, I recommend you to opt for ovulation induction. Delayed periods once in a while are not a concern if you are a previously regularly menstruating woman. You can choose to wait for 10 more days for your periods or take Tab. Regesterone 5 mg twice daily for 5 days. Periods are expected to happen 2 to 7 days once you stop medication. Hope this has answered your question. Good luck.",

Both Oxacillin and Ethambutal are placed in category c for their use in pregnancy, which means there is no sufficient evidence of their teratogenicity. However, they should be used with precautions when the benefits outweigh the side effects and are essential for controlling tuberculosis in pregnant women. The doses offered to you are in the normal range. I suggest you continue taking the medication as per the advice of your treating doctor and also have regular pregnancy check-ups.",
    "1443": "Hello, based on your clinical signs and MRI findings, it appears to be a case of poster Central disc protrusion.

Few sessions of short wave diathermy may also be helpful, but not continuously. It would be best to consult a physiotherapist who is certified and experienced in MC. Kenzie manual therapy techniques for the spine. Traction therapy can also help reduce the radiation. If these measures don't provide any relief, you can consider NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). If there is no improvement, OZONE THERAPY may be an option. In the worst case scenario, surgery may be the only solution. I wish you a pain-free and enjoyable life soon.",
    "1444": "Hi. Good question. Whether the surgery is done by a general surgeon or oncologist surgeon depends on the size of the lump, its exact site, and whether you are unmarried or married. Any surgeon with a good practice knows these criteria well, so please do not worry. A general surgeon can do this nicely. Please discuss with him all the points I have noted. Whether the lump is cancerous or not is the most important criteria and an excision biopsy is the best way, so go ahead. The surgeon will definitely be concerned about the aesthetic appearance.",

If you need further clarification or have more questions, please don't hesitate to seek additional support. Best wishes for your meeting tomorrow!",
    "1446": "Hi, thanks for the query. I assume that your urine albumin levels were high and that is why a biopsy was recommended. If you are experiencing difficulty in passing urine now, it may be due to a blood clot in the bladder, which may have formed due to post-biopsy bleeding. Therefore, I recommend that you get an ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder, as well as a urinalysis. Based on the results, your nephrologist can discuss further treatment options with you. Hope this helps, good luck!",

To differentiate between restrictive and obstructive lung disease, a spirometry test is recommended, which is a pulmonary function test. A chest x-ray may also be helpful in determining the cause of the pain. Avoid smoking to prevent further damage to your lung tissue. Take care.",

First, you should undergo a thorough investigation to ensure your body is suitable for natural conception. Tests for ovulation, tubal patency, male factor, and hormonal imbalances are necessary. Your ovarian reserve should also be evaluated based on your age.

This means you have been infected with the virus at some point but your immune system has mounted a response to it. \n\nOverall, you seem to be doing well and only feel a bit tired sometimes. While we recommend treatment to reduce the risk of liver disease and cancer in patients with high viral loads, it is ultimately your decision whether or not to take medication for life.

Based on your description, you have been trying to conceive with your wife for nine years without success.

    "1634": "Thank you for your query. I have gone through it. The swelling below the tongue can be a cystic lesion arising from the sub lingual salivary gland, which is called a ranula. If this ranula permeates through the mylohyoid muscle and spreads down to the neck region and produces swelling in the neck region below the mandible, it is called a plunging ranula. Consult an oral physician and get it ruled out, because an infection arising from the teeth can also result in pain and swelling of a similar kind. Get an ultrasound done to rule out any pathology. If it is diagnosed as a ranula or plunging ranula, then it has to be treated surgically to prevent complications like difficulty in swallowing and respiratory problems. The nasty taste can be because of the contents of the cyst, which gets burst following any trauma to the cyst. I hope my answer will help you. Take care.",

Non dilated IBR and CBD means that your bile ducts are fine, not dilated. Your gallbladder is fine as well. Some pancreatic enlargement, probably not significant. It is very hard to tell what your doctor was thinking about. Abdominal ultrasound is not a good test for setting final diagnosis so if your doctor have any doubts, he should send you to abdominal CT. If it is about your symptoms, most probable reason of it is a peptic ulcer, acid reflux. It is advisable for you to have upper GI endoscopy. Full blood test with pancreatic enzymes and liver enzymes should be performed as well as urinalysis. Hope this will help. Regards.",

    "1641": "Hello, after your fall and surgery, it usually takes 6-8 weeks for the bone to heal properly. If there is no infection, the healing process should progress smoothly. A recent x-ray would be helpful to assess the current status of the bone healing. Additionally, there may be some indentation due to the fixation material, which is not a cause for concern. It is important to walk regularly and perform physiotherapy to encourage positive changes. The pain could be due to pressure on the muscle and skin from the internal fixation structures, or maybe there is still some infection left that is causing metabolic waste to accumulate and lead to pain. You can have a blood test and an x-ray to rule out infection and assess the healing progress. Please note that the term \"metastasis\" is not applicable in this context, as it refers to a different level of pathology. With just a fall and surgery, other serious pathologies are unlikely.

Additionally, she should have a physical examination of the breasts and mammography or ultrasonography to rule out cancer, as it is important to exclude any possible malignancy in someone of her age.

Based on your symptoms of itchy hands and feet, redness or flushing of face, and swelling or hives along with allergic angioedema, it seems like an allergic reaction. As you mentioned, both times when the symptoms appeared, you were taking Omeprazole. Therefore, it seems like the symptoms are due to an allergic reaction to Omeprazole, which is a Proton Pump Inhibitor. I suggest consulting an Allergist for a thorough clinical evaluation and advice on allergic tests like LAST test, Patch test, and food challenge test to rule out the exact cause of the problem and treat you accordingly. For now, you can take anti-allergic medication like Allegra or Benadryl. The best way to prevent an allergic attack is to avoid exposure to the allergen. If it is something you come in contact with frequently, you can be advised immunotherapy to reduce the severity of allergy symptoms. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards.",

    "1653": "Patient, overbite does not necessarily mean that your jaw is not aligned correctly. Overbite is a condition where your upper teeth bite too far forward, causing a gap between your lower and upper front teeth when you close your mouth. This can be corrected with braces or retainers, which can move your jawbone and teeth into a more aesthetically pleasing position.\n\nBraces can move your lower jaw outward and correct the overbite by pushing your lower teeth backward. However, this is not always necessary, and it depends on the severity of your overbite and the position of your jawbone.\n\nIf your jawbone is properly aligned and does not require significant movement, then braces alone may be sufficient to correct your overbite. However, if your jawbone is not properly aligned, then surgery may be necessary to correct the position of your jawbone.\n\nIn your case, I would recommend starting with braces or a retainer to correct your overbite. If your jawbone is properly aligned, then this should be sufficient to correct your overbite and improve the appearance of your face. If your jawbone is not properly aligned, then we may need to consider other options, such as jaw surgery or a combination of braces and surgery.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that jaw surgery is a major procedure that requires significant recovery time and may have some risks associated with it. Therefore, it should only be considered if necessary and after a thorough evaluation by a dentist or oral surgeon.\n\nFinally, age is not a factor when it comes to correcting overbite or aligning your jawbone. Although growth may have stopped in your jawbone, that does not mean that you cannot correct your overbite or align your jawbone through dental treatment.",

This test can help us determine whether the white spots are due to leprosy or not. However, as a preliminary test, you can prick the white spot with a pin and check if there is a loss of sensation. If there is a loss of sensation, it may indicate that the white spot is due to leprosy.\n\nIf you have any further clarifications or queries, feel free to ask. We would be happy to help you.",

In our practice, we usually assess the gall bladder status in follow-up for such patients and whenever there are gall stones or sludge in ultrasound or patients have discomfort with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (HERD), we convince the patient to go for cholecystectomy.

Low sperm count and motility issues can be caused by a variety of factors and it is important to undergo further testing to identify the specific cause of your condition. If you want to increase your actively motile sperm count, there are several options available to you.\n\nFirstly, lifestyle changes such as improving your diet, reducing stress and stopping smoking can help improve sperm quality. In addition, some men may benefit from using natural supplements such as vitamins, minerals and herbal extracts to support their sperm production and motility. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before taking any supplements to ensure they are safe and effective for you.\n\nIf your low sperm count is caused by a varicocele, you may require surgery to correct the issue. Other causes of low sperm count such as urinary tract infections or hormone imbalances may require specific treatments such as antibiotics or hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIf your sperm motility is low, your doctor may recommend using assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments such as insemination or in vitro fertilization (IVF) to help with conception. These treatments can bypass the issue of low sperm motility by directly inserting the sperm into the female reproductive tract.\n\nI hope this information answers your question.

In addition to local application, you might need a course of oral antifungal medicine like Fluconazole 150 mg once a week for four weeks. There is also a possibility of having a worm infestation like thread worms, which can also cause itching and irritation in that area. Consider having a stool test for ova and cysts, and if necessary, take an anti-helminth medicine course like Albendazole. Take care.",
    "1815": "Hi, Hope this message finds you in good health. It sounds like you might be experiencing some sort of hormonal imbalance or variations in your body, which is not uncommon when taking the contraceptive pill. However, it's always important to monitor any changes in your body, so it might be a good idea to consult a gynecologist if your symptoms worsen or persist.

    "1816": "Hello. I read your question carefully, and I understand your concern. Although belching and gas are not common symptoms of heart disease, they may be connected in some cases. In late stage congestive heart failures (CHF), due to heart pump failure, every organ system suffers from not enough blood delivered by the failing heart. This may cause digestive issues that result in belching and gas. However, it is important to note that belching and gas are not always related to heart disease. Other factors such as diet, digestive system issues, and other health conditions may also contribute to these symptoms. I recommend that you consult a gastroenterologist to rule out any digestive system issues that may be causing these symptoms. If your father's heart disease is under control, he may be able to manage these symptoms through lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. I hope this information is helpful.",

The ear, nose, and throat are interconnected, so secondary to the trauma, there might be an infection, which could have led to secondary bronchitis. It's recommended that you get an investigation done with a chest x-ray and an ear examination through endoscopy. If needed, an antibiotic course will be prescribed.

First the best thing to do is to prevent the infection of Australia antigen which is a particle of Hepatitis B virus detected in the blood of an infected person. Hepatitis is transmitted via blood or blood products, body fluids and from mother to child. Infection can be prevented by taking Hepatitis vaccination which is freely available.  If you are not vaccinated by now then get your blood Bag test done and if negative then get vaccinated at your earliest to prevent the risk of getting infected.

    "1823": "Hello, your child is experiencing fever, vomiting, and stomach ache. Generally, a medicine like Advil or ibuprofen can cause gastric irritation, vomiting, and pain in the stomach due to gastritis, as well as rectal irritation. It is better to check her temperature using a digital thermometer in her armpit. If the temperature rises above 100 F, then give her Advil and monitor her fever. Note the fever-reducing effect after giving the medicine, her activity in between the fever episodes, her appetite and diet. Never give Advil on an empty stomach as this causes gastric irritation. Provide her with soft diets and fluids, such as soups. Ensure she eats small, frequent meals with at least three to four times a day to reduce the gastric irritation. The pain in the anus seems to be probably because of the medicine or gastritis. If the pain persists, you can apply lidocaine jelly to the area to relieve her of the pain after ensuring her diet and fluid intake are adequate. Hope I have answered your query.

If these results are normal, then there is no need to worry about heart diseases. Sometimes, gastritis can also cause ventral burning chest pain. I would recommend that she take an antacid like pantoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) on an empty stomach. Please don't worry, she will be fine.

    "1832": "Dear patient,\n\nI understand your concern regarding your delayed period and the uncertainty surrounding it. I would like to clarify a few things to help ease your mind.\n\nFirstly, it is not uncommon for periods to be delayed due to mild hormonal imbalances. This can be caused by various factors such as stress, anxiety, travel, change of place, weight loss, thyroid hormone problems, and polycystic ovaries. Therefore, it is not surprising that this is the first time your period has been delayed.\n\nSecondly, your doctor has prescribed Duphaston to be taken twice a day for 7 days to address the hormonal imbalance and help regulate your menstrual cycle. It is important to follow the instructions provided and complete the course of medication.\n\nFinally, regarding the X-ray examination that you are scheduled to take for your new job, it is generally safe to undergo an X-ray if you are not pregnant. However, if you are still concerned, it is advisable to wait for one more week and take a pregnancy test before taking the X-ray. This way, you can be certain about your menstrual status and proceed with the X-ray examination without any worries.\n\nPlease finish the course of Duphaston as prescribed, and if you still have concerns after that, feel free to consult with me or another doctor for further advice.\n\nBest regards!",

As this is an incurable disease, we will need to pursue palliative treatment. The best option for recurrent malignant pleural effusion is pleurodesis. This involves creating iatrogenic adhesion of the pleural layers, thereby obliterating the pleural space and preventing fluid accumulation. To accomplish this, you will need to consult with a pulmonologist and undergo thoracoscopy with the removal of all fluid, followed by talc powder application to the surface. This will cause an intense inflammatory reaction that results in fibrosis and pleural adhesion, ultimately obliterating the space. Please consult with a pulmonologist to discuss these options in detail.",

    "1860": "Hello, the enamel of the teeth can be damaged by acid in the mouth. Acidic gastric contents during repeated episodes of vomiting can easily damage the enamel on teeth. This would occur after the teeth are erupted and have been exposed to the acidic environment. This could then be the case with the baby teeth. Now you state the adult teeth have weak enamel. This could be a genetic weakness. Nutrition and medication taken while the teeth are forming will affect the quality of the tooth structure. If a child sleeps with a bottle with milk products coating their teeth, it can cause decay. Fluoride can be given to children during tooth development, but as adults the addition of fluoride is not recommended because teeth are already formed. Instead, topical fluoride can help strengthen formed tooth enamel. Too much fluoride taken as a child can have the reverse effect of weakened enamel forming. Often white spots are seen and indicate too much fluoride. The antibiotic Tetracycline is known to darken the layer under enamel and cause gray to brown banding if taken while teeth are forming. No concern with this type of discoloration when taken as an adult. The medication, Pizotifen, does not report any significant dental side effects concerning enamel.",

If you are working on a computer, there are several posture related adjustments that can help you speed up your recovery and help you maintain your cervical spine strength over time. Ergonomics is the field of science which deals with such adjustments. I would suggest you to go through websites which deal with ergonomics for working on a computer and adopt those postures. Apart from this, you should avoid sitting or standing in the same posture for more than 20 to 30 minutes at a stretch, avoid looking into or playing on your phone for more than 2 to 3 minutes. These minor modifications can help you maintain good cervical spine postures. Hope this helps. All the best!",

    "1873": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. It takes a very high dose of radiation in order to cause any harm to pregnancy. In the early first trimester, high doses of radiation will produce miscarriage, rather than a genetically abnormal fetus. Furthermore, a cumulative radiation dose of under 5 rd (which is the radiation in about three CAT scans) has not been shown to be a risk for malformations in developing human fetuses. Amniocentesis, or chorionic villus sampling, can only detect diseases of the chromosome of the fetus. The fetuses chromosome are formed at conception, and would not be affected by radiation exposure. Therefore, these tests are not necessary unless a high risk is detected on the routine screening tests such as the triple test use in all pregnancies to calculate risk for chromosomal abnormalities. So in summary, I would not recommend aborting this pregnancy based on a radiation exposure under 5 rd before fetus even develops. I agree with your doctor to do the routine genetic screening-which consists of a triple test with nuclei translucency (NT) beginning at 11 weeks gestation and only consider amniocentesis or CVS if that testing appears normal. A level II ultrasound also is essential in every pregnancy to rule out birth defects. However, I want to reemphasize that if the fetus survives the first trimester, It is unlikely that the radiation exposure caused any effect on the pregnancy at all. I hope that I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice is reassuring. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy.",

Sometimes a disc can slip out of its usual place - due to injury or for other reasons. This is also called disc herniation or disc protrusion. A herniated disc presses on the spinal cord inside the spinal canal. Because the size of the canal is now smaller due to the protruding disc inside the spinal canal - this is what is called the \"canal compromise\". Myelomalacia means that your spinal cord - the nervous tissue is damaged - the location of the damage at c4/5 means that it is in your cervical spine at the level between 4th and 5th cervical vertebrae - which is your neck area.

    "1971": "Hi! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. You did not mention your gender. Developing such lumps in case of a male person in this age group happens not infrequently, and is due to hormonal changes in this age. These usually subside by themselves excepting in a few in which case you might have to consult a plastic surgeon if disturbing both physically and mentally. In case of females also, this might be due to some hormonal changes, and this would need a clinical assessment. If clinical assessment was inconclusive, then one could go for FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) to have a cytological diagnosis and then proceed further.

Spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing can help to assess lung capacity, type of airway problem, and confirm or rule out the diagnosis of asthma and similar diseases. If you have asthma and allergies in the past, allergy testing for common air-borne allergens can identify substances causing allergies and measures to avoid them.

It also evaluates the nature of the lump and its relationship to adjacent structures and the source of the lesion. In the case of a small cyst with less infectious features, a course of antibiotics may help.

    "1996": "Hello, a few days of fever without any localizing signs could also be a viral illness. What is more important is the activity of the child between two fever episodes on the same day. If the child is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably a viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once the viral fever comes, it will last for 4-7 days. So don't worry about the duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

    "2013": "Hello and thanks for your query. It is important to determine whether you have had a fever. Given your past history of asthma, it might be beneficial to receive a review from your treating physician or pulmonologist. What were your latest peak flow values or spirometric follow-up details? A physical examination to check for the presence of wheezes or other crackles would be important. This could help determine whether there is an associated infection, and other tests like a complete blood count and C reactive proteins may be necessary. Other conditions like TB and latent pulmonary infarction or embolic should not be overlooked. I suggest you receive a proper review from your pulmonologist or internist. Best regards, Bain LE, MD.",
    "2014": "Hi Ravikant,\n\nI have reviewed your question and I want to assure you that tuberculosis does not affect the IVF cycle or the baby during treatment. However, since you have already started treatment for uterine tuberculosis, it would be best to complete the treatment first before proceeding with the IVF cycle. This is to ensure that the infection is properly managed and there are no potential risks to the baby.\n\nAdditionally, uterine tuberculosis does not spread through sexual intercourse. It is a localized infection that mainly affects the uterus.\n\nI hope this answers your question. If you have any further concerns, please feel free to ask.",
    "2015": "Thank you for your query. It seems that the numbness in your face, chin, lips, and teeth could be caused by the pressure from your wisdom tooth, which is broken. It could also be a result of a cystic lesion stemming from the wisdom tooth. \n\nTo determine the exact cause of your numbness, it is recommended that you consult an oral physician and get a radiographic or CBCT exam. If a wisdom tooth with a cyst is present, it may require the cyst to be removed along with the wisdom tooth. If I am your treating doctor, I would suggest you to take nerve regenerating medication in the meantime. \n\nPlease take care and consult an oral maxillofacial surgeon for further treatment.",
    "2016": "Hello. Your symptoms of loss of interest and confusion are consistent with a diagnosis of depression. Additionally, your medical conditions such as diabetes and blood pressure can make you more prone to depression, especially given the stress of your situation. I understand that you have been treated for depression but have not seen significant improvement. There could be several reasons for this. Firstly, your blood sugar is still elevated, indicating that your diabetes is not under control. Secondly, your son's performance in college may be a persistent source of stress. Thirdly, your current medication may not be effective. Fourthly, you may need psychotherapy in addition to medication to help you cope with these stressors and recover from this condition. In my opinion, you should evaluate which problem is most significant and seek appropriate intervention.",
    "2018": "Hello, thank you for your query. Based on the information you have provided, it appears that you have a low sperm count (oligospermia). To improve your sperm count and potentially increase the chances of conception naturally, the following measures may be helpful:\n\n1. Regular exercise for 45 minutes followed by meditation for 30 minutes in the morning. This can help improve overall health and blood flow to the reproductive organs.\n2. A high-protein diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, along with supplements of vitamin A, C, D, E, and Zinc. These nutrients can support healthy sperm production and function.\n3. Antioxidants such as Almonds 5-6 every day. Antioxidants can help protect sperm from damage caused by free radicals.\n4. Avoid alcohol and smoking as they can negatively impact sperm health and function.\n\nPlease note that these measures may not immediately increase your sperm count, but if followed over a period of time, they may help improve overall reproductive health. If you and your partner are still experiencing difficulties with natural conception after trying these measures, it may be recommended to seek further evaluation and treatment from a fertility specialist.",
    "2019": "Hello, thank you for your query. It seems that you have noticed some difficulties with ejaculation and the quantity of semen is very low. This is a common occurrence at your age due to decreasing testosterone levels. However, it is nothing to be worried about. The pain while ejaculating could be due to Prostatitis, which can be controlled by taking antibiotics like Doxycycline for two weeks.",
    "2022": "Thank you for sharing your daughters' symptoms with me. It appears that there are several possibilities for their chest pains, dizziness, trouble breathing, lightheadedness, and red dots on the body. While the doctor may have initially suspected a pulled chest muscle in your 22-year-old daughter, the presence of these additional symptoms suggests a more complex condition.\n\nBased on the symptoms you have described, it seems like your daughters may be suffering from allergic bronchitis. This condition can cause symptoms like breathlessness, chest pain, and reddish skin lesions. CAT scans would likely be normal in this case because it is not a structural lung disease, but rather a functional impairment of the lungs.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that both daughters undergo Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT) to assess their lung function. They may also require treatment with inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) along with antihistamines and anti-allergic medications.\n\nI hope this information helps you and your daughters. Please take them to the nearest hospital or medical facility for further evaluation and treatment. Wishing your daughters a speedy recovery.",
    "2024": "Hi, I understand your concern. Your son falling and hitting his cheekbone on the wooden table caused trauma to the soft tissues. This led to inflammation and the formation of inflammatory exudate, as well as the rupture of blood vessels, leading to blood spillage into the surrounding soft tissues and bruising. The soft tissues also showed signs of inflammation, with fibrous tissue proliferation and accumulation of inflammatory cells in that area, encapsulating the hematoma and forming a hard lump. The black eye was due to blood accumulation in the area. As the blood dissipated, the bruising subsided. However, the lump formed due to inflammation and hematoma formation takes longer to resolve. It's nothing to worry about, as it will gradually subside. I recommend consulting a physician for evaluation of any underlying bony fractures. If a fracture is present, reduction of the fracture segments and fixation may be required. If there is only soft tissue injury, you can apply alternate warm and cold packs over the swelling, and using thrombophob gel containing heparin sodium will help in faster dissolution of hematoma. For pain, Tylenol or eugenic kid can be given. Thank you for your query. If you find this answer helpful, please write a positive review and click on \"find this answer helpful\" as a token of appreciation.",
    "2025": "Hello, based on your description, it could be a soft tissue tumor like lipoma, neurofibroma, dermatofibroma, a cyst, or an abscess.

Additionally, the liquefaction time is not mentioned in the report, but it should be less than 30 minutes. To increase sperm motility, consider the following lifestyle changes: avoid hot water baths, relieve stress, eat plenty of fruits and green leafy vegetables, and stay well hydrated. It is important to consult an infertility specialist prior to taking any medication. I hope this answers your question. Good day.",
    "2029": "Dear patient,\n\nThank you for your query. Based on your description, I believe that the lumps in your epigastric area are likely just subcutaneous fatty tissue being prominent, also known as lipoma. This is a common occurrence among individuals who are overweight or obese.\n\nYour weight is on the higher side, and this is most likely the cause of your bloating, nausea, and discomfort in the center of your chest. The pressure you feel in your chest and back is likely due to gastroesophageal reflux, a condition that often affects overweight individuals.\n\nTo alleviate these symptoms, it is essential to lose weight. Obesity can lead to a variety of health problems in the long run, including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. To achieve a healthy weight loss, you should consider making dietary changes and leading an overall healthy lifestyle.\n\nPlease avoid lying down immediately after eating and make efforts to reduce your weight. Losing weight will help alleviate your symptoms and improve your overall health in the long run.\n\nBest regards,",

    "2031": "Dear patient,\n\nThank you for seeking our advice and sharing your health concerns. Based on the symptoms you have described, there are several possibilities that we need to consider. One possibility is a heart ailment, which can cause chest tightness and discomfort. If not investigated and treated, it can lead to a real heart attack. Therefore, I recommend that you proceed to have an ECG done and consult with a cardiologist. The cardiologist will be able to guide you further. Another possibility is HERD (acid reflux from stomach to esophagus), which can also cause chest tightness and discomfort. For this condition, an endoscopy of the stomach may be required to confirm the diagnosis. Lastly, anxiety disorders can also contribute to your symptoms. If the ECG and endoscopy results are normal, it may be necessary to consult a psychologist for further evaluation and treatment. I hope this information helps you. Please feel free to write to us for further clarification. I wish you good health.",
    "2035": "Thank you for your question. Given that your cardiac workup is normal, I believe you are suffering from HERD (Castro Esophageal Reflux Disease). This is due to the laxity of the gastroesophageal sphincter. As a result, the acid from your stomach tends to rise into your esophagus and cause the symptoms. Please follow these steps for better symptomatic relief:\n\n1. Avoid hot and spicy food.\n2. Avoid large meals; instead, eat frequent small meals.\n3. Avoid stress and anxiety.\n4. Start taking proton pump inhibitors.\n5. Go for walks after meals.\n6. Keep two to three pillows under your head in bed.\n7. Avoid smoking and alcohol if you have these habits.\n8.

Based on your description of lower abdominal cramping only during the night, discomfort enough to keep you awake, associated with lower back pain and staining throughout this time, it could be a mild form of hemorrhage. Due to your busy schedule, you may not be noticing it. I recommend seeking a direct examination by a Gynecologist and having abdominal and per-vaginal ultrasonography to determine an accurate diagnosis. Appropriate treatment can then be given. In some cases, curettage and biopsy may be necessary to rule out cancer of the uterus. Please follow up with your health care provider for further evaluation and treatment recommendations.",

If your discomfort continues, it's important to contact your dentist as they may need to change the antibiotic if it's not effective. Additionally, it's important to discuss which pain relief medication is recommended during your pregnancy with your doctor. Most pregnant patients are able to take acetaminophen for pain relief. It can be taken to relieve your immediate discomfort and reduce inflammation, if your doctor agrees. If your extraction is delayed, the tissue around the tooth may need to be cleaned out under local anesthesia. It's essential to keep the area clean and maintain proper daily dental hygiene. Consider a consultation with an oral surgeon if you don't feel relief soon. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you start to feel better soon.",

Although he has chosen not to undergo treatment, it's important to be aware of the potential spread of the cancer and the impact it could have on his quality of life.\n\nProstate cancer can spread to nearby organs and lymph nodes, as well as the bone. If left untreated, the cancer may metastasize widely, leading to further health problems and possibly death. The time it takes for this to occur depends on the Gleason score, stage, and grade of the cancer.\n\nIt's essential to consult a doctor to discuss treatment options based on the stage of your father's cancer.

CA-125 is often increased in many non-malignant causes as well. If your wife's symptoms continue, your gynecologist may recommend a mastectomy as a treatment option for the ovarian cyst, but that decision can only be made by her gynecologist. If any suspicious lesions are found on imaging, more radical surgery should be performed, and a pathology report should be obtained.

    "2058": "Hi, thank you for consulting with me. A fever of a few days without any localizing signs could be a viral illness. More important than the fever itself is the activity of the child. If the child is active and playing around when there is no fever between two fever episodes on the same day, it is probably a viral illness and does not require antibiotics at all. Once a viral fever comes, it will last for 4-7 days, so don't worry about the duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in a dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6 hours, only if the fever is more than 100F.

Swelling is a protective mechanism of the human body. However, if you notice any changes in the skin color near the injured area, such as black circles near the eyes, near the ear or jaw, it is recommended to go to the emergency room for examination. If your daughter has any bleeding from the nose, redness of the eyes, or bleeding from the ear, it is recommended to seek the opinion of a neurologist. Otherwise, most of the time, the swelling will subside on its own without major issues. However, it is still recommended to seek medical attention for a safer examination and follow-up treatment.

However, it also depends on the results of your liver biopsy (if there is active inflammation or not). Additionally, getting treated will prevent your chances of getting liver cancer. If you are coinfected with HIV, then you should definitely control the hepatitis B with medications since the risk of liver cancer is higher if you have both HIV and hepatitis B. Keep in mind that some HIV medications also work against Hepatitis B (such as tenofovir, also known as Arvada), which is why your doctor may have stopped lamivudine.",
    "2077": "Thank you for your question. Your dentist/surgeon is correct that the tooth will continue to grow and it's important to take action. Implantation is a very advanced technique, but it can be expensive. If it's a first molar, a bridge can be used as an alternative. However, if it's a second molar, an implant or removable denture is the only option. The removable denture can be quite inconvenient and requires regular cleaning and placement after every meal. On the other hand, implantation requires surgery and must be considered with your general health. It can also be expensive. However, both options prevent further growth of the opposite tooth and improve chewing ability. Please consider these options and take action soon.",

    "2093": "Dear patient,\n\nYou have presented with pain in your lower right abdomen. While appendicitis is a possibility, it is not the only possible diagnosis. Vomiting is just one of the symptoms of appendicitis, which is usually associated with right lower abdominal pain, nausea, muscle guarding, and fever. However, the absence of these symptoms does not exclude appendicitis as a possibility.\n\nTo rule out appendicitis, the best course of action is to go to the hospital for a blood test and ultrasound.

    "2140": "Hi, I don't find any reason for you to worry. When you say you had a pregnancy(irrespective of the outcome) it means you stand a very good chance of pregnancy again. Now having those symptoms which you mentioned are due to the progesterone hormone secreted in the second half of the menstrual cycle. It only suggests that the hormonal balance is slightly disturbed. You can wait for another week for your periods. If they occur, fine. If no periods, just do a pregnancy test again. If negative, meet a gynecologist who will start on hormone pills to regulate your menstrual cycle. The progesterone hormone, which is produced from the ovary after release of the egg, causes symptoms like-mood swings, depression, bloated feeling, heavy breast, air filled feeling in the bowels, etc. But once you have your periods, all these symptoms will disappear. You can also check your Thyroid profile & Serum Prolactin early morning in an empty stomach. Just to confirm if no other hormone has lost balance. I can give you a checklist to see if everything is fine and if anything is interfering with your ability to get pregnant. If anything is missing, get it done. Your husband should also have a Semen analysis done in an infertility center (preferably done 4 weeks apart).",

If both tests come back normal, then we can be relatively assured that your symptoms are due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is caused by laxity of the gastroesophageal sphincter. This allows acid from your stomach to come up into your esophagus, causing the burning sensation. I recommend starting proton pump inhibitors to reduce the acid production in your stomach. Please avoid stress and tension, as well as hot and spicy food, which can trigger these symptoms. Don't worry, you will be fine.",

Urea and creatinine are end products of protein metabolism that are normally excreted by the kidneys in urine. However, when there is a chronic parenchymal disease, the creatinine levels continue to rise. Unfortunately, the nephrons, which are the main functional unit of the kidney that excretes these end products in urine, do not regenerate once they are damaged in the disease process. Therefore, Dialysis is necessary to eliminate these waste products from the body. It is unlikely that the serum creatinine level (11) will come down through dietary changes or medications to a level where Dialysis can be avoided.",

One possibility is that the infection may have spread from the teeth to the gum tissue or the bone, causing an abscess.

    "2151": "Your brother's symptoms are consistent with a worsening of his COPD due to a viral infection. This has caused his chest to tighten and made breathing difficult. To address his symptoms, it is recommended that he consult a pulmonologist for a chest x-ray and a pulmonary function test (PFT). The chest x-ray will help rule out lung infection, while the PFT will assess the severity of his COPD. Based on the results of these tests, he may require treatment with inhaled bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. It is important to visit the emergency room to start treatment immediately and stabilize his current illness. Once his current illness has stabilized, he should receive adult respiratory vaccinations with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines to prevent future lung infections.",

    "2153": "Hello, after reviewing your question and the reference image you provided, it is difficult to determine if you have a varicocele without an examination. A varicocele can feel like a \"bag of worms\" during examination. If it is very large, it may cause pain. The main issue with varicocele is infertility, due to engorged blood vessels and blood stasis, which increases the temperature in the veins. As the testes are a nearby organ and connected, this high temperature can affect sperm production. It is recommended that you consult with your primary care physician to rule out the possibility of varicocele. If you are diagnosed with a varicocele, it is best to have it operated on. I hope this helps. Please write back for further queries. Wishing you good health.",

Additionally, a daily vitamin B complex supplement after meals, 500 micrograms of folic acid before meals, coenzyme Q10 three hours after meals, and 40 units of benfotiamine after meals every day may help him.

    "2169": "Hi, cancer is a complex disease that requires a multi-step approach for early detection. The tests you mentioned are primarily focused on assessing your risk factors for heart disease and stroke, rather than cancer. While some of these tests can provide clues about certain types of cancer, they are not specific or sensitive enough to detect all types of cancer with certainty. Detecting cancer early is crucial for successful treatment, but there is no single blood test that can detect all types of cancer. Depending on the type of cancer, different tests are available to aid in early detection. For example, mammography can help detect breast cancer, CT scan can help detect lung cancer, PSA blood test can give clues for prostate cancer, and a simple examination by a doctor can help detect head and neck cancer. Please consult your primary care provider or a specialist in cancer detection for further evaluation and testing recommendations.",

However, if it remains static or worsens, it is recommended to proceed with a CT Thorax and Bronchoscopy with BAD (Bronchoalveolar Lavage) analysis for culture and sensitivity. This will enable us to initiate targeted therapy and adjust the antibiotics accordingly. Please take the necessary steps to ensure your health and well-being.",

    "2185": "Dear patient, there are a few issues that need to be clarified. Let me explain them one by one.\n\n1. If you miss just one pill during the entire cycle of birth control pills, the effect of the pills remains and they do not fail. Therefore, the chances of pregnancy due to missing one pill are almost nil.\n2. On the 6th day of the menstrual cycle, there is no egg present for fertilization. The egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to the next expected menses. The egg has a life span of 24 hours, while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Therefore, a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is the fertile period. Unprotected sexual intercourse in the fertile period is most likely to result in pregnancy. Your intercourse was far away from the fertile period.\n3. There is only one method to reliably detect pregnancy one day after missing a period, and that is the Beta HCG test. This test can diagnose pregnancy even a few days before missing a period. Other home pregnancy tests performed on urine are reliable 8-10 days after a missed period. Earlier, they may give false negative results.\n4. If you had diarrhea after taking Doxycycline (which is a common side effect of these antibiotics), there is a chance that the pills may have been expelled before complete absorption and then the pills may fail to offer protection from pregnancy.\n\nPlease rewrite the doctor's response to answer the patient's question and translate it into English.",

However, the exact duration and degree of elevation can vary from woman to woman.\n\nIn your case, the temperature increase of only 0.1 to 0.2 degrees is not significant and is likely normal for your pregnancy. The normal body temperature is around 37 degrees Celsius or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

Based on your test results and the information you have provided, it seems like there are several factors that may be contributing to your difficulty in conceiving.\n\nFirstly, the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) in your biopsy sample is concerning. TB can affect the reproductive system and may contribute to infertility. It is important to continue with the treatment for TB and ensure it is fully eradicated before attempting pregnancy.\n\nSecondly, your insulin level is high, which suggests insulin resistance. This can lead to ovulatory dysfunction and infertility. It is recommended to monitor your blood sugar levels closely and consider consulting a diabetologist for further evaluation and management of insulin resistance.\n\nThirdly, the size of your follicles is increasing, which is a good sign. However, it is important to actively involve in sexual activity around the time of ovulation to increase the chances of conception. Discuss with your doctor for further advice on timing and frequency of sexual activity during this period.\n\nFinally, cervical inflammation (cautery) may also contribute to infertility. It is important to continue with the treatment for cervicitis and ensure it is fully resolved before attempting pregnancy.\n\nPlease continue to follow the advice of your doctor and monitor your health closely. Wishing you and your partner all the best with your fertility journey. Take care!",

    "2215": "Based on your daughter's symptoms, it seems like she's experiencing rapid heart rate, which is causing a fluttering feeling in her chest. In young individuals, the common causes for rapid heart rate are arrhythmia, anemia, hyperthyroidism, and stress. First, we should do an ECG to rule out arrhythmia. Then, we should check her CBC (complete blood count) and thyroid levels to rule out anemia and hyperthyroidism, respectively. If all of these tests are normal, it's likely that she's experiencing stress and anxiety, which can also cause burping. So, I recommend that she avoid stress and anxiety, and try to stay calm and relaxed.",
    "2216": "Dear patient,\n\nThank you for your question. After eating a candy bar or other sugar-laden product, your blood sugar level actually goes down to around 80-90 and remains low until your next meal. This is due to an excess secretion of insulin. At a time, overloading glucose is not good and you are straining your beta cells for more insulin.\n\nTo maintain a stable blood sugar level, it is recommended that you consume foodstuffs that release glucose slowly and constantly. These include proteins and low-glycemic index foods. It is also recommended to eat more fiber-rich food such as green leafy vegetables and fruits (not juices with sugar). If you need to sweeten things, choose sweets made with artificial sweeteners or sugar-free sweeteners. It is also important to exercise at least an hour a day. Take your medications on time.\n\nBest wishes to you! Please contact us if you have more questions.",
    "2217": "Dear patient,\n\nThank you for your question. I understand your concern about your blood pressure remaining high despite taking the prescribed medication.\n\nFirstly, it is important to note that medications used for controlling blood pressure often take several weeks to show their full effect. Therefore, if you have been on the medication for only 5 days, it may be too early to expect a significant reduction in your blood pressure.\n\nHowever, if you are experiencing any symptoms that are bothering you or if your blood pressure remains high despite taking the medication as prescribed, it is important to consult your doctor on priority. Your doctor can assess your condition and recommend appropriate measures to manage your blood pressure effectively.\n\nTherefore, I suggest that you make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible to discuss your concerns and ensure that your treatment plan is appropriate for your condition. Your doctor can provide further guidance and support to help you manage your hypertension effectively.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSukhvinder",
    "2218": "The constant stomach pain and low back pain could be related to many conditions. Some of them are gastritis, gastric ulcer, constipation, urinary tract infection, liver issues, or ovarian cyst. However, the only way to determine the cause is through an abdominal ultrasound. Based on the ultrasound report, you can then consult a doctor for a detailed discussion on treatment options. At this time, I cannot diagnose any particular condition as there is no available history, such as when her pain is worse, which part of her abdomen hurts, if the pain has been increasing over the past few days, or if the pain intensity is consistent. A physical examination is also necessary to check for bloating in the stomach. Please see a physician for proper examination and treatment.

    "2224": "Dear patient,\n\nThank you for bringing up your concern. It seems that you have been experiencing more frequent cold sores while taking Microgestin birth control pills for the past three months.\n\nFirstly, it is important to note that Microgestin birth control pills may increase your risk of developing cold sores. This is because the medication can weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to viruses and other infections. However, it is also possible that the increase in your cold sore frequency could be due to other factors such as stress, lack of sleep, or a change in your diet.\n\nTo help reduce the frequency of your cold sores, we recommend that you:\n\n1. Discuss with your ORGAN other methods of contraception to reduce the risk of developing cold sores.\n2. Apply topically Hegel oral ointment over the affected area.\n3. Rinse your mouth with lukewarm saline and antiseptic mouthwash.\n4. Take multivitamin supplements and antioxidants.\n5. Drink plenty of fluids rich in vitamin C such as lemons and oranges.\n6. Maintain good oral hygiene.\n\nPlease note that it may take some time for your body to adjust to Microgestin birth control pills, so the frequency of your cold sores may decrease as you continue taking the medication. However, if the problem persists or worsens, it is important to consult a doctor for further evaluation and advice.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Take care!",

    "2242": "Dear patient,\n\nI have carefully reviewed your description of the pea-sized lump on the outside of your elbow, beneath the skin. It is fairly hard to the touch and painful when your arm is resting on your desk or when it is gently pressed. When you extend or retract your elbow to its full range of motion, there is some discomfort in the joint. When your elbow is bent all the way, the lump is very hard to find, if at all. It sort of aches after it is touched.\n\nIn my opinion, the lump could potentially be one of two things: either a lump related to tennis elbow or French cellulitis. It is important to consult both a surgeon and an orthopedic surgeon to differentiate between the two possibilities.\n\nIf it is tennis elbow, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), rest, and if it recurs, a steroid injection can relieve chronic tennis elbow. However, if it is a boil on the outer elbow, then antibiotics, NSAIDs, and cold compresses can help reduce the lump. If it does not respond and increases in size, then proper surgical incision and drainage may be necessary.\n\nI hope this information clarifies your concern.

The treatment of back pain is usually through exercises and analgesics (diclofenac). Sometimes, vitamin D deficiency can be the cause, so it is recommended to get your vitamin D levels checked. If they are low, vitamin D supplementation (with milk) can be taken. Avoid standing for long periods of time. Sit in a straight posture. Eat milk and milk products, fruits, and green leafy vegetables daily. As per my understanding, you have a tender spot on the left side.

As you describe, my opinion is that we are dealing probably with extrasystoles. These are electrical impulses generating from parts of the heart different from that of normal sinus rhythm. They cause this escaped or skipping beats. You may feel a palpitation, an anxiety sensation or like a beat is skipping. There are different reasons that may generate an extrasystol from simple emotional stress to different pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. Hypertension and extrasystoles are independent of each other meaning that you may have extrasystoles without having hypertension, you may have hypertension without extrasystoles or both of them. The fact that you have a low blood pressure is good news you don't have to worry about this. In fact this is our goal when we treat hypertension. Now we have to deal with this skipping beats. My opinion as a cardiologist is that we are not talking for something urgent. I will recommend you to tell your symptoms to your treating doctor in your next visit to make some simple examinations like a blood analyze, your thyroid hormones. Of course if I was your treating I will recommend a holter monitoring to register and see what happens with your rhythm during these symptoms. If you feel that your heart is beating in a chaotic way it is advisable to make an electrocardiogram in that exact moment to your nearest cardiologist. In mean time avoid coffee and caffeine products because they exacerbate these symptoms. When we document and see what kind of rhythm problem is this we can talk about treatment. Hope I was helpful.

Given your severe chronic backache and RA, let's consider each of these issues individually.\n\nRegarding your back surgery, what surgeries did you undergo and why were they performed? Additionally, have you tried physical therapy before or after the surgery? Physical therapy can help you with therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy to symptomatically control the pain. It is also important to strengthen the muscles supporting your spine and core as they provide support to the joints. The body has a natural ability to heal itself, and medication and physical therapy can provide support until the body takes over.\n\nFor RA, regular exercise such as meditation, breathing exercises, and general body exercises can help. Exercises should focus on improving muscle strength and maintaining joint mobility. It's important to understand that the body has a natural ability to heal itself, and only you can improve your body's metabolism through exercise. There is no external device that can help improve metabolism. Self-induced effort is the only way to regenerate bodily functions and provide optimal relief.\n\nPlease maintain a civil tone and abide by the rules of social media. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to contact me.",

    "2270": "Dear patient,\n\nThe majority of herpes infections are spread through sexual contact and intimacy. Sometimes, even touching the sores of an infected person can contaminate your hands, and if you touch your genital area with those hands, it may cause herpes type 2 infection. While transmission of the virus through routes such as sharing bed linens, clothing, towels, toilet seats, eating utensils, shared cups/glasses, and in public spas is less likely, the possibility cannot be completely ruled out.\n\nPlease do not worry. Just follow the treatment plan of your doctor. It's completely curable. \n\nFeel free to contact me if you have any more questions. I'll be glad to help you.\n\nBest regards,\n[Chat Doctor]",
    "2271": "The hormone drug therapy that your oncologist is considering would specifically target the estrogen receptors in the tumor cells. This is because your cancer was estrogen-dominant, meaning that it depends on estrogen to grow and multiply. The drugs anastrozole and trastuzumab would work by blocking the estrogen receptors, preventing the tumor cells from getting the signal they need to grow.\n\nHowever, these drugs can have side effects, and it's understandable that you don't like the idea of them. Some of the possible side effects include hot flashes, joint pain, and changes in the skin, among others.\n\nIf you're concerned about the side effects, your oncologist might consider other options for you. These could include other hormone therapies, such as tamoxifen or fulvestrant, which also target estrogen receptors but might have different side effect profiles.\n\nThe recommended length of time on these drugs is typically 5 years, but this can vary depending on your individual risk of recurrence. Your oncologist will take into account factors like your age, overall health, and the size and type of your tumor when making this decision.\n\nYour oncologist's advice to proceed with the targeted treatment seems reasonable given your risk of recurrence. If you have any further questions or concerns, it's always best to discuss them with your oncologist directly.",

This is quite common, so I suggest you follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by applying the gel on affected areas for one hour the second night, two hours the third night, three hours the fourth night, and then apply it overnight.\n2. After this period, wash your face with a soap-free face cleanser (such as Nivea) during the day.\n3. The gel can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so it's advisable to use a sunblock with a minimum SPF 30 throughout the day.\n4. As for the scars on your face, it's recommended that you consult a dermatologist to discuss options such as Microdermabrasion and chemical peeling to lighten them.

    "2285": "Hello, I understand your concern. The sore throat around your period is a common occurrence known as PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME. Avoiding spicy food and taking an antacid before meals during and around your period can help. Warm saline gargles can also provide relief.\n\nThe swollen and painful gums around your wisdom tooth are likely due to inflammation, known as PERITONITIS. This can occur as a result of food deposition between the gum flap and the wisdom tooth, or if the flap is bitten by the opposite jaw tooth. It can lead to pain radiating to your jaw, throat, ear, eye, and head.\n\nIn this case, it is recommended to consult a dentist and get an x-ray done.

We recommend performing blood tests to check for Chlamydia, Cytoplasm trachomas, Urea plasma urealitycum, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes infections. If any of these are positive, we recommend treating the infection.\n\nWhen the baby is born, we recommend checking him for any signs of infection and monitoring his condition through ultrasound at regular intervals.

Try to identify the source of your stress and work on finding solutions. You may need anxiolytic medication. Don't worry, you'll be fine with all this. I hope I've answered your question. I'm happy to help you further. Wishing you good health. Thanks.",
    "2333": "Hi, thanks for your question. Based on your inquiry, my opinion is as follows:\n\n1. Alcohol can affect nutrition. Common nutritional deficiencies include vitamins and minerals, often resulting in electrolyte imbalances. This can increase the risk of cancer and gastritis.\n2. However, alcohol has no specific effect on T cells or eosinophils.\n3. The immune suppression caused by alcohol is usually secondary to malnutrition, which can increase the risk of infection.\n4. Parasitic infections can occur more frequently in alcoholics, which can further increase eosinophil counts. It is recommended to avoid or limit alcohol consumption.\n\nIf you have any further questions, I would be happy to help you again.",
    "2334": "Hello, it seems like your son is experiencing a viral diarrhea. Once it starts, it will take about 5-7 days for him to fully recover. However, if your son has low urine output, is very sleepy, or has blood in his motion or green bilious vomiting, you should be concerned. Antibiotics are not necessary unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics may worsen the condition if used unnecessarily, causing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. I suggest you give your son zinc supplements.",
    "2336": "Hello, thank you for your query. Diabetes, if uncontrolled, can lead to high blood glucose levels. This in turn can cause an increase in urination, resulting in more frequent and larger volumes of urine. This can lead to increased thirst, as your body tries to replace the fluids lost through urination. Additionally, the watery diarrhea you are experiencing can also contribute to increased thirst. The cause of the diarrhea may be a gastrointestinal infection, which can also lead to nausea and vomiting.\n\nTo address these issues, it is important to achieve strict blood glucose control, which will improve your overall health. Additionally, you may need oral rehydration therapy, as well as a course of antibiotics, such as ornidazole, and ofloxacin for five days. If the nausea and vomiting persist, an anti-emetic like domperidone 10 mg once or twice a day may also be necessary.\n\nPlease take these recommendations seriously and seek medical attention promptly.",

If your child's adenoids are indeed enlarged, it's possible that they will gradually regress over time. However, if your child's symptoms persist or worsen, it's recommended to consult a doctor for a thorough examination and evaluation. Surgery may be considered in severe cases where the adenoids are causing significant respiratory issues or other symptoms. In the meantime, you can try gargling with lukewarm water to relieve some of the discomfort. If your child's age is appropriate, this may provide some relief. Please note that it's important to consult a doctor for professional advice and treatment recommendations.",

First, change your position slowly, especially when going from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. When you get out of bed, sit on the side of the bed for a few seconds to gain your orientation and allow your circulatory system to adjust. Second, when walking, focus on distant objects and avoid looking down at your feet. Avoid walking in dark areas or on unstable ground. You can also use a cane, walking stick, or walker for support and to give additional pressure and touch (tactile) orientation. Avoid activities that move the head up and down repetitively, and try to avoid keeping the head tilted back for long periods of time, for example painting or dusting above your head. Finally, be cautious when using medications that may cause balance problems as a side effect. I hope that you have found something helpful in my response.

    "2347": "Hi, and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I understand your concerns about the swelling around your kidney area. However, it is important to note that kidney cancer does not typically manifest with this type of swelling. The most likely explanation is that the antibiotics you are taking for the urinary infection are causing some temporary discomfort or side effects.\n\nIf the swelling persists or gets worse after the antibiotics are finished, it is important to see a doctor again for a thorough examination and possible tests such as a CT scan to rule out any other possible kidney disorders.\n\nPlease try to stay calm and rest assured that your symptoms are most likely temporary and related to your urinary infection.

We should actively pursue a physical examination to assess the strength of the pelvic floor, any fluid collections, cysts, or masses within the abdominal cavity. Initial diagnostic tests could include an abdominal ultrasound and abdominal CT scan. We also need to perform kidney function tests to rule out any early kidney dysfunction. Additionally, urine cultures and sensitivity tests are required to exclude a urinary tract infection, considering the risk of bacterial growth within the pelvicalicial system. It's important to consult with your internist/nephrologist for a comprehensive review. Best wishes for your health. Regards, Bain LE, MD.",

    "2351": "Mrs. Newsome, your concern is understandable. However, based on your husband's current condition and the tests performed, the surgeon's plan to proceed with the Whipple procedure is the correct course of action. Pancreatic cancer often does not cause pain or other symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage, making early detection crucial. The Whipple procedure is the only effective treatment for pancreatic cancer, and if your husband is healthy enough to undergo the surgery, it should be done as soon as possible.\n\nI suggest that you and your husband seek a second opinion from another experienced surgeon to confirm the diagnosis and treatment plan.

If it is diagnosed as a normal sprain, you have to take rest for 3 days at least and apply cold compress on the affected area. Please take diclofenac tablets combined with thiocolchicoside twice a day, along with Atrovent tablets at bedtime for 7 days. You will be fine in a week.\n\nBest regards.",

It seems that the pain in your lower right back gum radiating to the middle of your jaw may be caused by an inflamed gum flap around your wisdom tooth, also known as peritonitis. Another possible cause is a fractured crown or root portion of a tooth that may occasionally be missed in an X-ray. The treatment of irrigation with mouthwash indicates that peritonitis may be the cause. However, I would suggest you consult an oral surgeon and get evaluated. He can advise a full mouth X-ray and evaluation of your teeth, jaw, and jaw joint to rule out the possible cause of pain and treatment can be done accordingly. As of now, you can take higher painkillers like Tramadol or Motrin as it is suitable to relieve severe pain. Avoid chewing on the painful side. Take a soft diet. I hope this information helps.",

Root canal treatment is a successful treatment for infected teeth, but if the tooth decay has progressed to the bone, it can be a challenging situation. As a young adult, it's important to consider your long-term oral health and not just the short-term cost of treatment.\n\nIf the decay has progressed significantly, it might be necessary to extract the tooth. However, before making that decision, it's important to get a second opinion from an Endodontist, who specializes in root canal treatment. They can evaluate your situation and provide you with a more detailed treatment plan.\n\nIf the Endodontist determines that a crown is not necessary or possible, they might recommend other treatment options such as a post and core to support the tooth or even a dental implant if necessary. These options can help preserve your oral health and allow you to maintain a functional smile.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to seek further opinions and treatment options.

    "2378": "Based on the information you have provided, it seems that your son has been diagnosed with hemochromatosis. This condition is a genetic disorder that causes the body to absorb and store too much iron, leading to iron overload.\n\nFirstly, it is important to monitor his iron levels closely. The serum ferritin level of 430 is relatively high, indicating that his body is storing a significant amount of iron. Reducing his red meat intake and avoiding shellfish are good steps towards managing his condition. However, he should also limit other sources of iron, such as tea and iron supplements.\n\nExercise can help reduce iron levels by increasing the rate of iron loss through sweat and urine. Therefore, his decision to work out 2-3 times a week is a positive step. However, he should avoid strenuous exercise that may cause iron-related fatigue or shortness of breath.\n\nGenetic testing is important to confirm the diagnosis and to determine if other family members may be at risk for hemochromatosis. If the genetic test is positive for hemochromatosis and his liver enzymes are normal, therapeutic phlebotomy may be recommended. This involves removing blood from his body on a regular basis to reduce iron levels. If his liver enzymes are elevated, a liver biopsy may be necessary to assess the extent of liver damage.\n\nIf end-stage liver disease develops, liver transplantation may be considered as a treatment option. However, this is a complex decision that requires careful consideration by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.\n\nPlease note that this response does not constitute medical advice.

    "2398": "Hello, Emergency contraception can create significant disturbance to the hormonal balance of the body, which can lead to delayed periods. If you took the pill within the prescribed time frame, it should provide sufficient protection against pregnancy.

Please wait for your next natural period and if you do not experience one even after 10 days past the due date, seek medical attention for further evaluation. I hope this helps.",
    "2399": "The idea of poisoning the blood to fight cancer cells has been considered, but it is not a practical approach. Poisoning the blood could affect healthy cells and cause serious side effects. Instead, doctors use targeted therapies that specifically attack cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. There are several types of targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. These therapies attack cancer cells in different ways, such as blocking growth signals or killing cancer cells through other mechanisms. \n\nIn addition to traditional chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, modern cancer treatment often includes targeted therapies to help fight cancer more effectively while limiting side effects. However, cancers can become resistant to treatment, and some cancers are more difficult to treat than others. The best approach is to work with a medical team to develop a treatment plan that is best for each individual patient's specific type and stage of cancer.",

If you have all of your top teeth decayed past the gumline, it is likely that there is infection in many of your teeth and gums, which is causing the bad breath. You may also be experiencing symptoms of stomach infection and weakness due to the spread of bacteria from your mouth to your stomach.\n\nTo address these issues, I recommend that you seek treatment from a dentist. They will perform a comprehensive evaluation and determine the best course of treatment for your teeth. If any teeth cannot be saved, they will be extracted, and those that can be saved will undergo root canal treatment and capping. Additionally, you should brush your teeth twice daily and use a concentrated mouthwash twice a day to reduce bacterial count. Always gargle with water or mouthwash after meals to maintain good oral hygiene.\n\nFor the stomach infection, I recommend consulting a gastroenterologist to rule out any infection. If an infection is present, they may prescribe antibiotics such as Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole to treat it effectively.\n\nPlease take these recommendations seriously and seek professional treatment promptly.

However, protein is not a medicine like Paracetamol or Amoxiclav, which are accused of causing hypertransaminasemia, or alcohol, which is accused of causing hepatitis with GOT more elevated than SGPT. Supplement proteins are more problematic when used in people with kidney disease. Therefore, I would advise you to decrease the effort in the gym and have a reevaluation of GOT and SGPT after two weeks.",

As you are already 34 years old and have been trying for 3 years, it is necessary to perform a thorough evaluation by doing a laparoscopy + hysteroscopy. Why laparoscopy? Sometimes, patients may have minimal endometriosis or mild adhesions that can affect the function of the tubes and lead to infertility. By doing laparoscopy, adverse factors can be ruled out or treated. Additionally, the tubes can be evaluated under direct vision. Hysteroscopy is a procedure where the inside of the uterine cavity is viewed using a camera, and any pathology found can be treated at the same time. Laparoscopy is a day care procedure where you can go home the same day or the next morning. Don't be scared. As your doctor already said, you can try IUI after laparoscopy because there is a good chance of conception immediately after surgery. If 3 IUI failures occur after laparoscopy, you can proceed with IVF. IVF can be done directly, but you need to undergo hysteroscopy before IVF for the reasons explained above. Trust your doctor.

I would also like to know what group of antibiotics were taken by you. As per the history, you are suffering from recurrent Urinary Tract Infection, with raised infection parameters (TLC-24000/mm3 and ESR-40). Recurrent UTI can occur due to a number of different causes in males and females. Uncontrolled Diabetes is an important cause for both genders, hence it is advisable to get your blood sugar screened (fasting and post radial blood sugar). In elderly male patients prostatomegaly is an important cause, which can lead to recurrent UTI. In elderly female subjects, bladder neck obstruction (mainly age related) can cause raised residual urinary volume, which can again lead to recurrent UTI. An ultrasonography of kidney-ureter-bladder with assessment of residual urinary volume helps in this case. Inadequate antibiotic dosage for inadequate duration is another important cause of recurrent UTI. This can lead to emergence of Chat Doctor. A urine for routine examination and culture is needed (though in all probabilities your culture may be negative since you have received multiple courses of antibiotics). I would advise you to consult your physician since you need a thorough check-up and some specific investigations, as your infection parameters are raised (an intravenous course of high-end antibiotics may well be required after assessment). It will be slightly difficult to manage your case at home, since you are not responding to oral antibiotics.

The loss of RBCs could be internal or external. It is recommended to consult a hematologist for further investigation and management.

Starting today, you should make lifestyle modifications such as cutting salt in your diet, getting regular exercise, and keeping track of your blood pressure at different times on different days. At the same time, evaluate for secondary causes of increased BP and treat the cause if found. If necessary, a single antihypertensive in a small dose may be necessary to control your blood pressure, which we can gradually decrease and wean off if possible.",
    "2461": "Mohammed Maqsood Ali,\n\nThank you for your query. Left hilar region calcification is suggestive of a healed, inactive scar lesion. It is not an active lesion, and thus no treatment is required. It is likely that you have had tuberculosis or pneumonia in the past, which has healed after treatment and left a calcified lesion in the left hilum.\n\nIf bronchoscopy and BAD (Bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis are negative, you can argue with the visa authority about not having an active, infectious disease and that your lesion is healed and non-continuous.

You have been prescribed Meoxicam 15 mg once a day, but it is no longer providing relief.\n\nBased on this information, it is possible that your pain is being caused by a compressed nerve root in your buttock, which could be associated with sacral arthritis. I recommend that you undergo an MRI scan to further evaluate these symptoms. Additionally, analgesic and neurotrophic medication may be started in the interim.\n\nTo alleviate the pain until the MRI scan is complete, avoid lifting weights and sit with support for your back. You may also consult with a physiotherapist for additional help, as physiotherapy techniques like ultrasound and inferential therapy can provide quick relief. Additionally, I recommend checking your B12 and D3 levels.\n\nIf you have any additional questions or follow-up queries, please feel free to write to me. I wish you good health and take care.",
    "2464": "Dear patient, the warmth of our body and extremities is maintained by the blood flow inside the vessels, which is partially controlled by nerves. Based on this logic, there are two possible conditions that could be causing your symptoms:\n\n1. Vascular damage: You should get an arterial/venous Doppler and USG to confirm this.\n2. Nerve damage: Although rare, as you are still able to walk, and since you haven't mentioned any loss of sensation in your foot, I assume the sensation is still intact. However, a simple sensory and motor examination will rule out this possibility.\n\nTo definitively answer your question, you should go to your GP and discuss the aforementioned things. All the best to you.",

    "2468": "Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. If your ECG and blood report are normal, then why was a beta blocker prescribed? Here, a cardiac history should be evaluated. If needed after examination and auscultation, an echo should be done. Additionally, a chest x-ray should be evaluated for respiratory causes if needed. A CRP test can reveal any inflammation or infection if present in the body. As you have a history of burning, acid reflux can lead to chest pain as referred pain. For this, omeprazole is given. The treatment will be guided according to the specific cause. Please consult a pulmonologist for examination.",
    "2469": "Hello, after reading your query, it seems like you have a supernumerary tooth in the upper jaw between your two front teeth. You mentioned that it is stable and doesn't cause any problems, except for how it affects your smile. \n\nThe best treatment option aesthetically is to remove the supernumerary tooth. This will close the space that is currently present, either automatically or you can choose to go for orthodontic treatment. The estimated costs will depend on the local rates for extraction and orthodontic correction (if required). Extraction is recommended because it won't make an awkward smile like if it was capped or bridged. \n\nI suggest you go to a dentist for a clinical evaluation and X-rays so that you can receive a more accurate treatment plan and cost estimate. This is a common procedure that shouldn't cost much. \n\nI hope this helps you in making a decision. Wishing you a healthy day!",
    "2470": "Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would like to explain that the total level of cholesterol is not a reliable indicator of your cardiovascular risk. A Total cholesterol/LDL ratio greater than 4.5 could indicate a higher cardiovascular risk related to dyslipidemia and the need for statin therapy. On the other hand, it is true that steroids can cause an elevation in cholesterol levels. Therefore, for the time being, I would recommend some dietary modifications (reducing saturated fats and increasing foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids). As soon as you stop taking steroids, your cholesterol levels will return to normal again. I hope this answer is helpful to you! Best wishes,",
    "2471": "Hello, Thank you for your query. If your wife takes adequate rest and medications there is a very good chance that she will complete the term and deliver a full term baby. It is essential to monitor the baby's movements and practice some relaxing techniques like meditation and breathing exercises to calm your wife's mind. False contractions (Braxton - hicks) may be felt and are usually irregular. If the contractions are regular and become more frequent with period like pain, contact her obstetrician right away. If it occurs after 37 weeks, the baby will be mature enough to survive on its own, but if it occurs before 37 weeks, steroid injections may be necessary to speed up the lung maturation process. If before 35 weeks, attempts to delay Labor will be made. However, there is a risk of preterm Labor, but if closely monitored with rest and medications, this can be minimized. It is essential to be prepared for any event. Keep the doctors' and hospitals' Labor room numbers handy along with someone who will be able to assist you during that time. Pack a weeks worth of clothes for yourself, your wife, and the baby. Plan for someone to travel back and forth between the hospital and home or for someone to stay with your wife while you do so. I hope this helps. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with. Wishing you all good health and praying for a safe confinement.",
    "2472": "Hello, thank you for your question. I have gone through your son's history and would like to make some suggestions for him:\n\n1. There are many causes for wheezing in children, including childhood asthma, viral infections, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n2. Firstly, I would not recommend taking omnacortil (prednisolone) as self-medication for cough, even if it is due to wheezing. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid and can have many side effects. It should only be taken for severe wheezing on the prescription of a doctor.\n3. If I were treating your son, I would ask for a detailed description of his symptoms to identify the possible cause of the wheezing. I would also like to know about his family history of allergies and other relevant information.\n4. For symptom relief, I would prescribe montelukast + levocetirizine for allergic cough-cold and albuterol inhaler for cough wheezing (It is always good to be examined by a doctor to know which type of cough it is).\n5. For diagnosis, I would suggest allergy testing for common allergy-causing substances, which will help identify the substances causing problems and also indicate measures to avoid them.\n6. In general, I would advise avoiding exposure to dusts, smokes, and air pollution as much as possible.\n\nI hope the above suggestions will be helpful to you.

    "2506": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. You can use regular birth control pills as emergency contraception, but you must take 4 pills twice- 12 hours apart. In short term dosing, this is not an issue with smoking nor will it be affected by any other medicines you are taking. However, emergency contraception really is only effective within 72 hours of unprotected sex. You may develop nausea and vomiting as a side effect from all the estrogen in the pills. Emergency contraception kits are available in pharmacies that have a different kind of hormone and fewer side effects. Depending on where you are in the world, you do not necessarily need a doctors prescription. These kits can work up to 5 days after intercourse (though most effective within 72 hours) so I recommend you use a store-bought kit rather than the Corvette. If you do use emergency contraception, it usually either delays your period or makes it come about 2-4 days after taking the medicine. So either way, if you miss your period, you should do a pregnancy test just in case. I hope I was able to answer your question and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,",

    "2513": "Patient,\n\nThank you for your question. Based on just one monitoring scan on day 9, it is impossible to determine your chances of conception. Follicular monitoring requires multiple ultrasound scans throughout the cycle. We need to track the follicle at least until day 14-15, when ovulation normally occurs. A follicle size of 8 mm on day 9 is normal, but a size of 22 mm is too large. The 22 mm on day 9 indicates a follicular cyst, which may be a remnant of the previous cycle. To determine if your cycle is ovulatory or not, we need to track the entire cycle. If ovulation is not observed, we can proceed with further testing of ovarian reserve and hormonal assessment of POD. Please take care.",

    "2523": "Hello, I have reviewed your query and understand your concerns about the toothache, diarrhea, and other symptoms you are experiencing.\n\nThe toothache after filling can be caused by several reasons. One possibility is inflammation or necrosis of the pulp, which is a tissue deep inside the tooth. This can occur when the filling is placed too close to the pulp, blocking the natural pathway for infection to escape and causing an increase in pressure within the pulp, leading to pain.\n\nAnother possibility is an asymptomatic tooth with a deep caries that previously was not diagnosed. After the filling is placed, it blocks the natural pathway for the infection to escape, leading to pain due to the increase in pressure within the pulp.\n\nRegarding your diarrhea, it could be caused by side effects of the medication you are taking. It is recommended to take probiotic medicines to help balance the gut flora.\n\nI suggest you consult your dentist if your symptoms persist. They will be able to assess your condition and provide further treatment recommendations if necessary.",

    "2526": "Based on the information you've provided, I'm aware of your concerns. It seems like your boyfriend may be exhibiting some obsessive or overthinking behavior, which can lead to him talking to himself, walking in circles, and having doubts about you. However, these actions do not necessarily indicate that he is psychotic. \n\nIf you are truly concerned about his well-being and want to help him, it might be a good idea to sit down with him and let him know that his behavior is concerning to you. Be open and honest about your observations, but do so in a supportive and understanding way. \n\nIf he's still not responsive or if his behavior continues to be concerning, it might be a good idea to seek professional help.

This type of injury can result in a number of complications, including rib fractures, pneumothorax, pulmonary contusions, and muscular injury. The first step is to get a chest X-ray to check for any abnormalities. If the X-ray is normal, then there's no need to worry too much; she probably has a muscular injury. It's important to avoid strenuous exercise, heavyweight lifting, and painful movements. You can give her painkillers and muscle relaxants. Applying a warm water pad to the affected area can also help. Don't worry, she should be fine.",
    "2528": "Gloria,\n\nThank you for your question. It's true that a spot on a chest X-ray can indicate various conditions, not just tuberculosis. Pneumonia, lung nodules, and lung cysts can also appear as spots. Therefore, we cannot assume that your father has tuberculosis solely based on the X-ray findings.\n\nTo determine the cause of the spot, we need to perform a sputum test. This requires your father to provide a sample of his phlegm. Without the phlegm sample, we cannot conduct the sputum test.\n\nI hope this answers your question. Please let me know if you have any further concerns, and I wish your father good health.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Doctor's Name]",
    "2529": "HI, I understand your concerns. However, flu is usually caused by a viral infection, and antibiotics only treat bacterial infection. Giving antibiotics at this point may not be beneficial and may even have negative impacts on your child's immune system. I recommend treating the fever with acetaminophen or ibuprofen syrup every 8 hours. If the fever persists after 3 days, then you can consider starting antibiotics as there might be a super added bacterial infection. However, if the fever resolves within 3 days, antibiotics are not necessary. It is important to rest, drink plenty of water, and use fever-reducing measures to support your child's recovery. I hope this answers your query. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
    "2530": "Hello, the spleen is an important organ in the human body. It plays an important role in filtering blood-borne bacteria and destroying damaged red blood cells. The spleen also produces important antibodies that help the body fight infection. However, if the spleen is removed, the body can still function normally. The filtering and antibody production functions of the spleen can be taken over by other organs in the body. Therefore, removal of the spleen will not usually affect a person's health. However, there are some risks. For example, the risk of infection may increase because some bacteria cannot be filtered by the spleen and may enter the bloodstream. However, such situations usually do not occur. If you have any further questions, please contact me.",

After the treatment, you can take him for an allergy test to confirm the diagnosis. If the test result is positive, you can start sublingual immunotherapy for milk allergies. Please take your son to the doctor for professional diagnosis and treatment advice.",
    "2533": "Firstly, the reason why the stone was not removed needs to be clarified by the surgeon. As for the loss of sensation in his leg, it may be due to an intense nerve block during spinal or epidural block. Sometimes, when inserting the needle, one might hit the nerve root leading to the above symptoms. Although he may have movement in the leg, the sensation will take time to recover. This is an uncommon presentation, but don't worry - severe injury to the nerve is very unlikely. It has been two days, and normal sensations should return soon.",

However, the typhoid liters in the Tidal test have not become more than 1:160 like 320 or 640. So it is unlikely to be a typhoid relapse. It could be a viral illness as well. Usually rather than the fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably a viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once a viral fever comes, it will last for 4-7 days. So don't worry about the duration if the kid is active. Regards -",

The accumulation of fluid due to salt and water retention is an important adverse effect of Sleeve chemotherapeutic drugs. This side effect is commonly seen during long-term treatment with Sleeve, and it may be associated with high blood pressure. Sometimes, the fluid gets collected in the lungs, causing difficulty in breathing, among other issues. Now, since the scan is not showing any evidence of the GIST, you may please consult your doctor to decide whether to continue with Sleeve for a few weeks or months. Lasix definitely helps in clearing the edema fluid, but it also has some side effects on its long run. Please take care of your health.",

It is unlikely that 60 ml is adequate for a child of this age. You may try increasing the amount of feeds and see if that satisfies the child. It is best to give the child feeding on demand and as much as the child demands. Sometimes the child ingests air along with the feed, causing discomfort and crying. Proper burping can help. Although weaning to semi solids is suggested from 6 months of age, you can start them at 5 months if the demands of the child are not met properly.

    "2574": "Hello. Interesting question. You seem to be well-read. However, there seems to be some communication gap. You said that the airways constrict. You mean airways in chest or the nasal passages? I suspect that you mean that your nostrils get blocked (because your spirometry is normal). Nostrils normally get congested (swollen) and they do get blocked. However, they do not constrict because there are no smooth muscles in the nasal passages! Normally, a virus infection does not last for 3 weeks. So this is post viral reactive airway causing airway (here I mean chest airways) constriction and post nasal drip. If the xopenex is causing side effects, it is better to stop using it. If the airways are constricted, it is better to use bronchodilators like salbutamol or albuterol. If the symptoms last for more than a month, it is better to see a pulmonologist or an ENT specialist for a thorough evaluation.

Based on your description of the trauma you experienced in February 2013, it is reasonable to assume that the injury was a contributing factor to the development of bone spurs in the C5-C6 area and mild disc bulges. Trauma is one of the potential causes of these conditions, along with aging spine processes, arthritis, and degenerative disease of the column. The fact that your symptoms started after the trauma supports the correlation between the two events.\n\nRegarding treatment, NSAIDs are commonly prescribed to manage pain and inflammation. In addition, physical therapy, exercises, and other conservative measures can be helpful for improving symptoms and preventing further damage.

    "2596": "Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. It is possible for a 19-year-old female and a 21-year-old male to be sterile, but this is rare in young people. Females become fertile once they start having menstrual cycles. Males become fertile around age 14 to 16 when they reach puberty and produce sperm. Before that age, they will also be fertile. I suggest that you have a follicular study done to check if you are producing eggs and to determine the best timing for conception. Also, I recommend that your husband have a semen analysis done. If both tests are normal, you can try to conceive normally for 3 to 4 years. If any abnormalities are detected, they can be treated. It is important that you have intercourse during the fertile period, which will be from day 12 to day 16 of a 30-day cycle. I hope this information is helpful. Regards",

    "2601": "The varicocele is a common cause of male infertility. A complete semen analysis report is necessary for better advice. If you have a varicocele, you should be more concerned about the decreased motility of sperms rather than the sperm count, as varicocele leads to a qualitative defect rather than a quantitative defect. Your sperm count of 25 million is good enough for fertilization. I would recommend you to start taking cap.Evian and tab. Lycopene, which are natural antioxidants, and they will improve the health of sperms. Secondly, I would advise you to get operated for your varicocele as it causes states of blood in the testis, and it increases the temperature within the testes, causing the sperms to die or deform, ultimately causing reduced sperms' motility.",

Thyroid abnormalities can cause irregular periods and infertility if not controlled. Once your thyroid levels are stable, your chances of conception will increase. You're still young and newly married, so there's still time for natural pregnancy. Try to avoid anxiety and stress about pregnancy, as they can cause hormonal imbalance and delay fertility. Relax and don't worry too much. Best regards...",
    "2658": "Dear patient,\n\nI understand your symptoms and the concerns about the lump in your neck that your previous doctor was unable to detect. In order to address this issue, I recommend that you get an ultrasonography done to locate the lump, if present. If the lump is found, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAC) can be performed to obtain a diagnosis of what it is.\n\nSecondly, your recurrent flu-like symptoms suggest that your immune system needs strengthening. I recommend taking multivitamins, having a proper diet, and doing exercises.\n\nPlease note that gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may also be a factor. I suggest undergoing an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to obtain a proper diagnosis and to seek treatment advice from a gastroenterologist.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your doctor's name]",
    "2659": "Thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Based on your description, I believe you are experiencing nerve compression when sitting, which is causing the pain, especially in a seated position. I suggest trying the following non-pharmacological measures for pain relief: 1. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid sudden jerky movements like bending, side movements etc. 3. Apply a warm water pad on the affected areas. 4. Avoid bad postures in sleep. If you don't see improvement within 1-2 weeks, consult an orthopedic doctor and get a lumbar spine X-ray to rule out compression. I hope this has helped answer your question. I'm happy to help you further. Wishing you good health. Thank you.",
    "2660": "Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your son's situation and problem. I don't find any relevant connection between chest tightness and brain pathology. Based on his history and description, the possibility of HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is higher. This is due to laxity of the gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid in the stomach tends to come up into the esophagus and cause the symptoms of central chest pain, burping, chest tightness, pressure, etc. It is better to rule out cardiac diseases first. So there is no harm in doing an Angiography. But before the MRI brain, discuss with the doctors about the possibility of HERD. He may improve with proton pump inhibitors and prokinetics. Ask him to avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Don't worry, he will be fine. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.",

    "2670": "Hello, I understand your concern regarding the dark spots on your cheeks. Hydroquinone can cause skin irritation and burning sensation, so it's important to use it cautiously and as prescribed by your doctor. The combination of Ban a Tan cream and Kojivit gel can be effective in treating melasma. However, the time it takes to remove the spots can vary depending on the severity and duration of the condition. It's essential to use sunscreen regularly and protect your skin from sunlight exposure, as this can worsen melasma. Additionally, a healthy diet rich in anti-oxidant foods like fruits and vegetables can help support your skin health.

    "2671": "Hi, Thank you for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about your father's lung cancer stage 4 diagnosis. Typically, patients with lung cancer stage 4 can expect a survival of about 2 years. Cancer is a challenging condition to treat, and each tumor behaves differently. However, we must continue to fight the disease. Since it is stage 4, surgery is not an option. Chemotherapy and radiation can be used to control the disease and prevent it from spreading to new areas. This treatment can add a few months to a year, which is significant. Parallel treatment with Buddha medicines can be considered as long as they do not interfere with chemotherapy or cause any side effects that may slow his recovery. Most Buddha medications are made from herbal sources. Research has shown that aswagandha may have potential against cancer-related fatigue, in addition to improving the quality of life. I pray for a speedy recovery for your father.",

Hypertension is a common problem in patients with diabetes, and it is essential to control blood pressure in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Beta blockers are commonly prescribed for patients with heart disease, but they may not be effective in controlling blood pressure in all patients. In your father's case, his blood pressure remains high despite taking beta blockers and other blood pressure medications. It is possible that there are other factors contributing to his high blood pressure. It is essential to evaluate his renal function, as diabetic patients may have renal dysfunction that maintains high blood pressure. If his renal function is normal, I would recommend adding another class of blood pressure medication to his current treatment plan.

    "2723": "Hello, thanks for your query. The causes of the enlargement of papillae on the tongue can be excessive smoking, which can cause irritation to the tongue resulting in its enlargement. Canker sores may also be present in the mouth without a known cause, and when a person is experiencing stress, this condition may be more severe. There are also some medical conditions that have symptoms that include the enlargement of papillae, such as HERD and ulcerative colitis. An oral cancer may be present if the sore does not disappear after two weeks. Infection may result from trauma to the tongue caused by biting, eating something hot or foods that are too acidic. Usually no treatment is required for this as the condition resolves within hours or days. Salt water mouth rinse, soothing foods such as yoghurt, antiseptic or local anesthetic mouthwashes, and topical steroids can also be helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

    "2728": "The backache that you have been experiencing for the past month could be due to several reasons. At your age, mechanical back pain is common, particularly due to faulty posture, lax abdominal muscles, and a sedentary lifestyle. Although you do not sit for more than 3 hours, frequent change of posture is essential to avoid back pain. It is also important to sit with your back perpendicular to the chair, avoiding forward bending. Additionally, abdominal muscle strengthening exercises should be started. Please avoid carrying heavy weights. The pain may also be related to bowel problems or anxiety. If you have irregular bowel habits or bloating, a high fiber diet and plenty of oral fluids are recommended. Avoid carbonated beverages, alcohol, and smoking. Daily relaxation sessions for 30 minutes before bedtime can help reduce stress. For increased pain, you can take Paracetamol 500 mg tablets as needed, with a minimum interval of 6 hours between doses. If the pain persists despite following these measures or if the test results are not normal, please consult a specialist in Orthopedics.",

More than one artery is involved (or the left main artery is involved), that's why your doctor has recommended a bypass surgery. There are other non-invasive methods like CT angiography to detect blockages in the heart, but an angiography provides the most information. No doctor will operate on a patient without first doing an angiography. Additionally, a bypass surgery has good results these days. It will require a 7-10 day hospital stay, and then a month of recovery at home. But the long-term effects of a bypass are very good, and he may not require another procedure for the next 10-15 years. He has significant blockages in the heart, so please don't search for other options and proceed with the bypass surgery. Thank you for posting here. Regards",

It's normal to feel a little anxious when it comes to pregnancy, but you and your husband are young and healthy, and there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to conceive soon.\n\nRemember that it usually takes about a year for a healthy, young couple to conceive without any problems. So even if you've been trying for a few months now, don't be too concerned if it hasn't happened yet. Keep trying and give it some time.\n\nYou mentioned that your prolactin level was slightly elevated, but it has now returned to normal after treatment. This means that your body is responding well to the treatment and there's no reason to worry about it affecting your pregnancy.\n\nIt's also important to note that about 15% of couples have trouble conceiving, even after a year of trying. So if you've been trying for a while and it hasn't happened yet, don't hesitate to seek help from a fertility specialist. They can perform additional tests and provide more specific advice on how to proceed.\n\nFinally, please don't forget to take folic acid while trying to conceive. This is a very important supplement that can help prevent neural tube defects in the baby and promote normal development.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your doctor's name]",
    "2785": "Hi, don't worry too much about the egg-sized, fluid-filled lump on your mother's forehead. This is a resolving hematoma and will resolve in time. However, since your mother also sprained her wrist, it should be X-rayed. This can be a good reason for her to visit the doctor. If necessary, you can request the doctor to aspirate the swelling with a needle. I know it can be difficult to convince her at her age, but try using the same approach you would for a child. She may cooperate more easily.",

Vomiting has stopped but you still burp often even when you haven't eaten anything. This can be a serious problem or it may go away with time. Hepatitis A virus is responsible for most cases of viral hepatitis A, which spreads through contaminated food and water. It is characterized by loss of appetite, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. The good news is that it usually subsides in 3-4 weeks and confers a prolonged immunity. Since it affects the liver, symptoms like vomiting, burping, indigestion, and heartburn are common but will gradually disappear over a period of time. Meanwhile, avoid hot and spicy foods, fatty meals, and alcohol. I hope this information is helpful to you.",

    "2794": "Based on your wife's symptoms, it appears she is suffering from Allergic rhinitis, which is inflammation of the nose caused by allergies. Common allergens that cause this include dust mites, animal proteins from domestic pets, and industrial dusts and fumes. It would be advisable to do an Allergic test to identify which substances your wife is sensitive to and causing symptoms. Management of Allergic rhinitis involves environmental control measures and allergen avoidance, as well as pharmacological management. Environmental control measures and allergen avoidance involve avoiding known allergens (substances to which your wife is found sensitive) and avoiding non-specific or irritant triggers. For dust mites, covering mattresses and pillows with impermeable covers can help reduce exposure. Bed linens should be washed every 2 weeks in hot water to kill any mites present. Thorough and efficient vacuum cleaning of carpets and rugs can help. Dust mites thrive when indoor humidity is above 50%, so dehumidification, air conditioning, or both can be helpful. Control measures for mold allergy focus on reduction of excessive humidity and removal of standing water. Complete avoidance of animals is the best option for animal allergy. Exposure to smoke, strong perfumes and scents, fumes, rapid changes in temperature, and outdoor pollution can be nonspecific triggers in patients with allergic rhinitis. Consider avoidance of these situations or triggers if they seem to aggravate symptoms. She might find relief by taking the following medicines: Steroid nasal spray like Fluticasone propionate or Mometasone, oral decongestant like Phenylephrine, nasal decongestant, saline nasal spray to moist the nasal cavity and remove allergen particles from the nose, steam inhalation.",

The neurocysticercus is an organism that occurs in 4 stages, and the cystic stage is the one that causes most seizures. Since your brother has the calcified stage, it is a healed stage and less likely to cause seizures. However, the fact that he had a seizure since 6 years means that the granuloma might be causing sudden outbursts of electrical activity. Seizures happen due to sudden outbursts of electrical activity in the brain and that can happen due to the old calcified granuloma or any new granuloma. Since a CT scan has already been done, proceed with an electroencephalogram to study the focus of abnormal electrical activity in his brain. Once the tests are done, he can be treated with anti-epileptic medications for months, and also he might need a dose of anti-helminthic should there be any active neurocysticercosis lesion.

If your prostate cancer has recurred after a radical prostatectomy in 1995 and your PSA score is 4.1 with no metastasis, the best treatment option depends on your overall medical situation.

I suggest having sexual intercourse during the 10th to 20th day of your cycle. Avoid stress, maintain a healthy diet, and consult a gynecologist for detailed examination if you have irregular periods.

    "2949": "Dear patient,\n\nThank you for your question. There are indeed different opinions on when a woman is most fertile. Some sources recommend 14 days after the first day of your period, while others suggest 14 days before you anticipate the start of your next period. However, the truth is that each woman has a unique menstrual cycle, and the most fertile time for each woman may be slightly different.\n\nTo accurately determine your most fertile time, it is recommended that you monitor your basal body temperature (BBT) and cervical mucus changes. Typically, the most fertile time for many women is approximately 2 to 3 days before the rise of BBT and the appearance of fertile cervical mucus. This is because the rise of BBT indicates the end of the menstrual cycle and the beginning of ovulation, while fertile cervical mucus provides a protective layer that allows sperm to survive and travel through the cervix and uterus to reach the fallopian tubes.\n\nIf you are still confused about your most fertile time, it is recommended that you consult a doctor or a fertility specialist for professional guidance and advice. They can help you better understand your menstrual cycle and fertility status, and provide more accurate recommendations based on your specific situation.\n\nBest wishes for your future pregnancy!",

It can be used either alone or more commonly in combination with other oral/systemic treatment options like biologics, methotrexate, and oral retinoids (e.g., accutane). Phototherapy sessions are usually administered thrice weekly and may take from 20-25 sessions to produce noticeable improvement. It is safe and is not associated with side effects like immunosuppression or increased risk of infection in contrast to other systemic treatment options like biologics, methotrexate, etc. Moreover, since psoriasis can recur, it is always better to have a treatment modality that is not only effective but also safe over the long run. I suggest you discuss more about phototherapy with his treating dermatologist.

    "2974": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. As a Urologist, I can understand your concern. It seems like you may be experiencing some side effects from your dialysis treatment. One possible cause of your symptoms could be changes in your electrolytes, specifically your potassium level. Although your potassium level is currently at 4.4, which is within the normal range, fluctuations can occur post-dialysis. Resting for a day after each dialysis session may help reduce these side effects. It's also important to follow a strict diet and fluid plan, as salt intake and blood pressure changes can contribute to cramping. Please continue to monitor your symptoms and follow up with your doctor for further evaluation and treatment recommendations.",
    "2975": "Dear patient,\n\nAs you are already on the Depo Provera shot, the likelihood of conception during its active period is quite low. If you wish to try for pregnancy as soon as possible, it is recommended that you discontinue the shot after your next due date in November. If there are no other issues, you should be able to conceive within a few months. It may take a couple of months for your hormonal cycles to normalize, as Depo is a slow-release progesterone, and the exact period of complete cessation of its hormonal effect may vary.\n\nI hope this answers your question.",
    "2976": "Dear patient,\n\nThank you for your query. Based on your description, your husband may be suffering from a rectal abscess caused by a rectal fistula. The surrounding skin and rectal tissues have a pathological connection, which leads to constant infection. This results in an abscess that causes pain, redness, and pus discharge.\n\nI recommend that you consult a surgeon for this issue. An incision may be necessary for proper diagnosis and treatment of the possible fistula. I hope this information is helpful. Regards.",
    "2977": "Hello, the pain on the left side of your back could be caused by several reasons. It could be muscle pain due to excessive cleaning or a pulled back muscle. However, it could also indicate a kidney infection, especially if you have been urinating more frequently. It is important to consult a doctor to rule out any possible kidney infection. In the meantime, you can try applying ice or heat to the affected area, depending on whether the pain is more severe or relieved by cold or heat. If the pain persists or worsens, please seek medical attention promptly.",
    "2979": "Hi, I have reviewed your question. I can appreciate your concern. Your father has cancer of the throat, but it appears to be in a late stage. Surgical intervention is not possible as the cancer has spread. Other treatment options include chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, if the cancer is not responding to treatment, no further treatment should be given. We can only provide symptomatic treatment. Treatment cannot cure the disease, and even with treatment, the prognosis remains poor. The expected lifespan is not good, and chemotherapy can cause many side effects, which further decreases the quality of life. Therefore, in my opinion, no treatment should be administered. I am sorry to say this, but it is the truth. If you have any further questions, I will be happy to answer them. Thank you for using Chat Doctor. I wish you and your family good health.",
    "2980": "Hello, thank you for providing the brief history. It appears that there is nerve root impingement in the lumbar spine causing discomfort in the thigh muscles. Inflammation in the lumbar spine is the cause of these symptoms. This can be controlled by strengthening the muscles of the lumbar spine. Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy can help reduce the pain and inflammation. Exercise is needed to strengthen the core and spinal muscles to stabilize the anatomical position of the bones in the lumbar spine and avoid recurrence. Regards, Jay In Chat Doctor.",
    "2981": "I recommend that you take your daughter to the doctor as soon as possible. The goose bump that developed at the back of her head after falling may be due to an external injury, but the vomiting and continued feelings of nausea are concerning. It is important to have your daughter evaluated by a doctor to ensure that there are no internal injuries. They may recommend a CT scan of her brain to rule out any potential damage. Please do not hesitate to seek medical attention for your daughter.",
    "2982": "Hello, I suggest you to wait for a few days before seeing a doctor. If the pain and numbness persist or worsen, it is recommended that you consult a doctor for a thorough examination and diagnosis. In the meantime, you can try applying ice to the bruised area to relieve the pain. Additionally, it is important to rest and avoid any strenuous activities that may further strain your back.

    "2983": "Hello, thanks for reaching out to Chat Doctor. I understand you are experiencing burning sensations in your legs, which is causing limitations in your leg activity. As a former smoker, it's important to consider the possibility of peripheral neuropathy, a condition that causes pain or burning sensation due to damage to the nerves of the legs.\n\nSmokers are at risk of developing plaques in the arteries of their lower legs, which can lead to pain on walking and burning sensation. To evaluate this possibility, we recommend a bilateral lower limb arterial Doppler test. If this condition is found, appropriate medications can be prescribed.\n\nAnother possible cause is long-standing diabetes. It's important to know if you have diabetes as it can affect your nerves and cause similar symptoms. We recommend getting fasting blood sugar, post-radial blood sugar, and HbA1c tests to confirm if you have diabetes.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take pregabalin 75 mg tablets at night for the pain. However, it's crucial to get evaluated for the underlying condition. Wishing you good health. Regards",
    "2984": "Hello, the Autofill bands can help close the gaps between your teeth, but they do not address the underlying condition of MAL occlusion of teeth. I suggest you visit an orthodontist for a comprehensive examination. They may recommend removing one or more teeth to make space and then aligning your teeth properly with braces. After the treatment, you will need to wear a retainer to prevent relapse. Therefore, even after using Autofill bands, you should continue to wear the retainer. It is best to consult an orthodontist for a professional opinion.",
    "2985": "HI. You have pain in urination for 8 years in spite of treatment and normal test results. This suggests that you have pain in the urethra. The most common cause is local urethritis, which is often non-specific and the cause can only be determined by direct inspection of the urethra using Cysto-urethoscopy. The treatment is to take urinary alkalizer syrup in water. Intestinal infection does not cause pain in urination.",
    "2987": "Hello, thank you for using Chat Doctor. I can understand your pain. Are you able to define the pain site clearly? If so, the most probable cause of your pain is trigeminal neuralgia. The nature of the pain is usually electric shock or needle prick, and the triggering event is similar to what you described in most patients. The pain is along the course of the trigeminal nerve, which is the fifth cranial nerve in the brain. The episodes of pain can be prevented. Carbamazepine is the first-line treatment for this condition. I hope this helps. Regards.",
    "2988": "Hi, thanks for the query. Polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) does not protect you from pregnancy, and it is not a guarantee that you cannot get pregnant. Your chances of getting pregnant are still high, and there is a significant percentage of women with PCOD who become pregnant even without treatment. Therefore, it is important to use regular and reliable birth control methods. Discussing the most convenient, appropriate, and suitable birth control methods for you with your doctor is my advice. Barrier methods, in particular, may be the most appropriate for you. However, this decision should be guided by your personal history, socioeconomic factors, and your actual clinical status. Thank",
    "2990": "Hello, even though your daughter is growing fine and is a calm baby, her nappies are smelly after she wees, which could be suggestive of a urinary tract infection. It is recommended that you get a urine routine analysis done. If there is evidence of a urinary tract infection, you should consult your pediatrician for management and follow up. If it is a urinary tract infection, she will require a repeat ultrasound abdomen also. The basic line of management will be antibiotic treatment after obtaining a urine sample for culture and sensitivity. Regards.",
    "2991": "I understand your concern about the pregnancy dating and the possibility of twins or inflammation. However, the doctor's assessment is based on her clinical experience and the sonogram is the most accurate method to determine the pregnancy age and the number of fetuses. If you are concerned about the accuracy of the dating, it is recommended that you consult a professional doctor for a more accurate assessment. Inflammation is not a common cause of pregnancy dating errors. If you have any symptoms of inflammation, it is recommended that you consult a doctor for further examination and treatment.",
    "2992": "The foods that can help reduce SGPT and GOT levels are high-protein foods, such as chicken, beef, and fish. However, it is important to avoid fatty and processed meats. Additionally, foods rich in antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables, can help reduce the levels of these enzymes. It is essential to consult your doctor before making any changes to your diet or stopping any medications.",
    "2994": "Hi.thanks for your query. Few tests are important in hormonal acne. The common hormonal tests done for this case are Serum Testosterone, DHEAS, S.prolactin’S.insulin, LH,FSH and cortisol. There should be an abdominal USG done to rule out pelvic pathologies. As for regular care of skin, you should use a sensitive mild cleanser. Try to use a Retinoid topically at night. Orally you should have supplements containing It C and It E to reduce the free radical induced damage to body and prevent aging changes. You also should apply non-comedogenic moisturizers containing It A and E in the morning. It is very important to avoid sun exposure and apply a broad spectrum sunscreen when you go out. Green tea is a good source of anti oxidants as well. So you can start having it. Hope this helps. Take care.",

    "2996": "Hello, pregnancy is a possibility given your irregular period and unprotected sex. The light pink discharge may be implantation bleeding. It's recommended that you take a home pregnancy test in one week. If your period does not arrive on time, a blood test for beta-hCG is necessary to confirm pregnancy.

Therefore, we need to change your antidepressants. Mirtazapine, sertraline, and bupropion are some options that we can consider. Additionally, along with the medications, you will also need cognitive behavioral therapy.

    "2998": "Hi Ms Wiley, it's nice to meet you. I understand you've fallen and injured your ribs, which is causing you some discomfort. Bruising and cracking of the ribs can take some time to heal, but the specific time it will take depends on the severity of the injury and your body's ability to recover.\n\nTo help with the pain and discomfort, I recommend icing the area and taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen. It's important to rest to give your body the chance to heal.

They may order an X-ray and recommend any necessary treatment, such as anti-inflammatory medication, vitamin supplements, or physical therapy.\n\nI hope this information helps answer your question.
